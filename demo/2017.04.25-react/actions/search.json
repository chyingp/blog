      "body": " About Two-Factor Authentication  Two-factor authentication, or 2FA, is a way of logging into websites that requires more than just a password. Using a password to log into a website is susceptible to security threats, because it represents a single piece of information a malicious person needs to acquire. The added security that 2FA provides is requiring additional information to sign in.  Configuring two-factor authentication via a TOTP mobile app  A Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) application automatically generates an authentication code that changes after a certain period of time.  Configuring two-factor authentication via FIDO U2F  After you configure 2FA via a TOTP mobile app or via SMS, you can add a security key that supports the FIDO U2F standard to use for two-factor authentication on GitHub.  Configuring two-factor authentication via text message  If you're unable to authenticate using a TOTP mobile app, you can authenticate using SMS messages. You can also provide a second number for a fallback device. If you lose access to both your primary device and your recovery codes, a backup SMS number can get you back in to your account.  Downloading your two-factor authentication recovery codes  After successfully setting up two-factor authentication via a TOTP mobile application or text message, the Two-factor recovery codes page lists your valid recovery codes.  Setting a fallback authentication number  You can provide a second number for a fallback device. If you lose access to both your primary device and your recovery codes, a backup SMS number can get you back in to your account.  Providing your 2FA authentication code  With 2FA enabled, you'll be asked to provide your 2FA authentication code, as well as your password, when you access GitHub.  Authenticating to GitHub using FIDO U2F via NFC  On your Android phone, you can use a FIDO U2F compatible security key and Google Authenticator to securely sign into your GitHub account with Near Field Communication (NFC).  Changing two-factor authentication delivery methods for your mobile device  You can always switch between receiving authentication codes through a text message or a mobile application.  Recovering your account if you lost your 2FA credentials  If you've lost access to your account after enabling two-factor authentication, GitHub can't help you gain access again. Having access to your recovery codes in a secure place, or establishing a secondary mobile phone number for recovery, will get you back into your account.  Countries where SMS authentication is supported  Because of delivery success rates, GitHub only supports two-factor authentication via SMS for certain countries.  Disabling two-factor authentication for your personal account  If you disable two-factor authentication for your personal account, you may lose access to organizations you belong to.",

      "url": "/articles/comparing-commits-across-time",
      "body": "Every repository contains a Compare view, which allows you to compare the state of your repository across branches, tags, commits, time periods, and more. The compare view provides you with the same diff tooling that the Pull Request view does. To get to the compare view, append /compare to your repository's path. We'll demonstrate the power of Compare by looking at the compare page for a fork of the Linguist repo, which is at https://github.com/octocat/linguist/compare/master...octocat:master. Every repository's Compare view contains two drop down menus: base and compare.  base should be considered the starting point of your comparison, and compare is the endpoint. During a comparison, you can always change your base and compare points by clicking on Edit.  Comparing branches The most common use of Compare is to compare branches, such as when you're starting a new Pull Request. You'll always be taken to the branch comparison view when starting a new Pull Request. To compare branches, you can select a branch name from the compare drop down menu at the top of the page. Here's an example of a comparison between two branches.  Comparing tags Similarly, you can compare across tags made for project releases. Comparing against tags is a great way to assemble release notes between different versions of your project. Instead of typing a branch name, type the name of your tag in the compare drop down menu. Here's an example of a comparison between two tags.  Comparing commits You can also compare two arbitrary commits in your repository. Comparisons between commits are made by providing either the full SHA hash or the short seven-character code. Here's an example of a comparison between two commits.  Comparing across forks You can compare your base repository and any forked repository. This is the view that's presented when a user performs a Pull Request to a project. To compare branches on different repositories, preface the branch names with user names. For example, by specifying octocat:master for base and octo-org:master for compare, you can compare the master branch of the repositories respectively owned by octocat and octo-org. Here's an example of a comparison between two repositories.  Comparisons across time Comparisons can be created for arbitrary time periods, like one month or two weeks. To define a time period, type the branch name, followed by a @, and then the date wrapped between a { } notation. For example, typing master@{2weeks} into the base dropdown menu compares the current master branch against the master branch as it was two weeks prior. Here's an example of a comparison between two time periods. You can also specify a specific date to compare against. Date formatting must follow the ISO8601 standard, which is YYYY-MM-DD--that's year-month-day. Here's an example comparing a branch from 2016-07-22 against that same branch several days later.  Comparisons across commits As a shortcut, Git uses the ^ notation to mean \"one commit prior.\" You can use this notation to compare a single commit or branch against its immediate predecessors. For example, 96d29b7^^^^^ indicates five commits prior to 96d29b7, because there are five ^ marks. Typing 96d29b7^^^^^ in the base branch and 96d29b7 in the compare branch compares the five commits made before 96d29b7 with the 96d29b7 commit. Here's an example of a comparison using the ^ notation.  Further reading  \"Changing the base branch of a pull request\" ",

      "body": " There are several ways to clone repositories available on GitHub.  When you view a repository while signed in to your account, the URLs you can use to clone the project onto your computer are available below the repository details:  For information on setting or changing your remote URL, see \"Changing a remote's URL.\"  Cloning with HTTPS URLs (recommended) The https:// clone URLs are available on all repositories, public and private. These URLs work everywhere--even if you are behind a firewall or proxy. In certain cases, if you'd rather use SSH, you might be able to use SSH over the HTTPS port. When you git clone, git fetch, git pull, or git push to a remote repository using HTTPS URLs on the command line, you'll be asked for your GitHub username and password. If you have enabled two-factor authentication, or if you are accessing an organization that uses SAML single sign-on, you must provide a personal access token instead of entering your password for HTTPS Git.  Tips:  You can use a credential helper so Git will remember your GitHub username and password every time it talks to GitHub. To clone a repository without authenticating to GitHub on the command line, you can use GitHub Desktop to clone instead.    Cloning with SSH URLs SSH URLs provide access to a Git repository via SSH, a secure protocol. To use these URLs, you must generate an SSH keypair on your computer and add the public key to your GitHub account. For information on setting up an SSH keypair, see \"Generating an SSH key.\" When you git clone, git fetch, git pull, or git push to a remote repository using SSH URLs, you'll be prompted for a password and must provide your SSH key passphrase. If you are accessing an organization that uses SAML single sign-on, you won't be able to clone with SSH. Instead, clone with the HTTPS URL.  Tip: SSH URLs can be used locally, or as a secure way of deploying your code to production servers. You can also use SSH agent forwarding with your deploy script to avoid managing keys on the server.   Cloning with Subversion You can also use a Subversion client to access any repository on GitHub. Subversion offers a vastly different feature set than Git; for a quick overview, see \"What are the differences between Subversion and Git?\" We have a separate article with more information on how to interact with GitHub using Subversion.

These supported custom domains are optimized for GitHub Pages. The most recommended custom domain types are bold.    Supported custom domain type Example domain     www subdomain www.example.com   one apex domain &amp; one www subdomain  example.com &amp; www.example.com    apex domain example.com   custom subdomain blog.example.com     Tip: We recommend using a www subdomain as your custom domain. If you choose to use an apex domain as your custom domain then we recommend setting up a www subdomain as well. To learn why, see \"www subdomains\"   Subdomains The term subdomain has two common meanings:   A customizable and optional part of a domain name located before the root or apex domain that looks like a domain prefix.  A type of domain that contains a subdomain part.  To avoid confusion, custom domains with different subdomain parts are assigned different labels. A custom domain without a subdomain part, such as example.com, is called an apex domain.    Subdomain Subdomain part Subdomain type     www.example.com www  www subdomain   blog.example.com blog custom subdomain     www subdomains A www subdomain is the most commonly used type of subdomain, in which the www stands for World Wide Web. For example, www.example.com is a www subdomain because it contains the subdomain part www. We strongly recommend that you use a www subdomain for these reasons:  It gives your GitHub Pages site the benefit of our Content Delivery Network. It is more stable because it is not affected by changes to the IP addresses of GitHub's servers. Pages will load significantly faster because Denial of Service attack protection can be implemented more efficiently.   Custom subdomains A custom subdomain is a type of subdomain that doesn't use the standard www subdomain part. It is commonly used to manage different host locations or computer servers. For example, blog in blog.example.io may be hosted on a different computer server than www.example.io or photos.example.io. GitHub Pages supports one custom subdomain per pages site.  Setting up subdomains A subdomain is configured with a CNAME record through your DNS provider. To learn more about setting up a subdomain, see one of these articles:  Setting up a www subdomain Setting up an apex domain and www subdomain Setting up a custom subdomain   Apex domains An apex domain is a root domain that does not contain a subdomain part. Apex domains are also known as base, bare, naked, root apex, or zone apex domains. In DNS provider settings apex domains are sometimes symbolized by an @ symbol. For example:   example.com is an apex domain because it doesn't have any subdomain parts. Whereas www.example.com is not an apex domain because it contains the subdomain part www.   Setting up apex domains An apex domain is usually configured with an A, ALIAS, or ANAME record through your DNS provider.

To set all commits in any local repository on your computer to be signed by default, run git config --global commit.gpgsign true. To store your GPG key passphrase so you don't have to enter it every time you sign a commit, we recommend using the following tools:  For Mac users, the GPG Suite allows you to store your GPG key passphrase in the Mac OS Keychain. For Windows users, the Gpg4win integrates with other Windows tools.  You can also manually configure gpg-agent to save your GPG key passphrase, but this doesn't integrate with Mac OS Keychain like ssh-agent and requires more setup.  If you have multiple GPG keys or are attempting to sign commits or tags with a GPG key that doesn't match your committer identity, you should tell Git about your GPG key.   When committing changes in your local branch, add the -S flag to the git commit command:  git commit -S -m your commit message # Creates a signed commit   After you create your commit, provide the passphrase you set up when you generated your GPG key.  When you've finished creating commits locally, push them to your remote repository on GitHub:  git push # Pushes your local commits to the remote repository   On GitHub, navigate to your pull request.

When you join an organization that uses SAML SSO, you sign in through the organization's IdP and your existing GitHub account is linked to an external identity that belongs to the organization. This external identity is separate from, but related to, your GitHub account and is used to control access to the organization's resources like repositories, issues, and pull requests. If you have an active SAML session in your browser, you are automatically authorized when you access a GitHub organization that uses SAML SSO. If you don't have an active SAML session in your browser, you must enter the credentials for your SAML identity provider before you can access the organization. GitHub supports these identity providers for SAML SSO:  Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Okta OneLogin PingOne Shibboleth Custom applications   Note: Outside collaborators aren't required to have an external (SAML) identity to access an organization that uses SAML SSO.  You must periodically log in to your SAML provider to authenticate and gain access to the organization's resources on GitHub. The duration of this login period is specified by your IdP and is generally 24 hours. This periodic login requirement limits the length of access and requires you to re-identify yourself to continue. You can view and manage your active SAML sessions in your security settings. To use the API or Git on the command line to access protected content in an organization that uses SAML SSO, you will need to use an authorized personal access token over HTTPS. OAuth application access tokens are authorized by default. You cannot use SSH to access organizations that use SAML SSO. If you don't have a personal access token, you can create a personal access token for the command line. To use a new or existing personal access token with an organization that enforces SAML SSO, you will need to authorize the token for use with a SAML SSO organization.

      "body": " There are two basic types of GitHub Pages: User/Organization Pages and Project Pages. They are nearly identical, but there are a few important differences between them.  GitHub Pages created after June 15, 2016 and using github.io domains are served over HTTPS. For more information, see \"Securing your GitHub Pages site with HTTPS.\"  Tip: GitHub Pages sites shouldn't be used for sensitive transactions like sending passwords or credit card numbers.  Note that Pages are always publicly accessible when published, even if their repository is private.    Type of GitHub Pages site Pages default domain &amp; host location on GitHub Location of the source files for building your Pages site     User Pages site username.github.io master   Organization Pages site orgname.github.io master   Project Pages site owned by a user account  username.github.io/projectname  master, gh-pages, or a /docs folder on master    Project Pages site owned by an organization  orgname.github.io/projectname  master, gh-pages, or a /docs folder on master     To learn how custom domains for GitHub Pages sites redirect, see this custom domain redirects chart.  User &amp; Organization Pages User &amp; Organization Pages live in a special repository dedicated to GitHub Pages files. You will need to name this repository with the account name.  You must use the username.github.io naming scheme. Content from the master branch will be used to build and publish your GitHub Pages site.  You can only use your own account name for a User or Organization Page repository. A repository like joe/bob.github.io will not build a User Pages site. When User Pages are built, they are available at http(s)://&lt;username&gt;.github.io.  Building your User &amp; Organization Pages User Pages can be built by any user account with a verified email address. They can also use deploy keys to automate the process. Organization Pages can be built by any member with push access to the repository and a verified email address. To automate builds, you can set up a machine user as a member of your organization. Deploy keys aren't supported for Organization Pages.  Project Pages Unlike User and Organization Pages, Project Pages are kept in the same repository as their project. Both personal accounts and organizations can create Project Pages. The URL for a personal account's Project Page will be 'http(s)://&lt;username&gt;.github.io/&lt;projectname&gt;' , while an organization's URL will be 'http(s)://&lt;orgname&gt;.github.io/&lt;projectname&gt;' . The steps for creating Project Pages are the same for both. Project Pages are similar to User and Organization Pages, with a few slight differences:  You can build and publish Project Pages sites from the master or gh-pages branch. You can also publish your site from a /docs folder on your master branch. For more information, see \"Configuring a publishing source for GitHub Pages.\" If you are not using a custom domain, the Project Pages sites are served under a subpath of the User Pages site: username.github.io/projectname If you are using a custom domain on User and Organization Pages sites, the custom domain will replace username.github.io in the URL for all Project Pages sites hosted under that account. Project Pages sites that use a custom domain are also available at username.github.io/projectname for personal accounts, and orgname.github.io/projectname for organizations.  Custom 404s will only work if a custom domain is used. Otherwise, the User Page 404 is used.   Warning: If the URL for your Pages site contains a username or organization name that begins or ends in a dash, or contains consecutive dashes, then people browsing with Linux will receive a server error when they visit the site. To fix this, change your GitHub username to remove non-alphanumeric characters. For instructions on how to do this, see \"Changing your GitHub username.\" ",

These instructions are optimized to work best with Jekyll themes that are officially supported by GitHub Pages. For a complete list, see \"Supported themes.\"  Customizing your Jekyll theme's CSS   Create a file called /assets/css/style.scss in the root of your site's repository.  Add the following content to the top of the file, exactly as shown: --- --- @import \"{{ site.theme }}\";   Add any custom CSS (or Sass, including imports) you'd like immediately after the @import line.   Customizing your Jekyll theme's HTML layout  Navigate to your Jekyll theme source repository's default.html file in the _layouts folder on GitHub. For example, navigate to https://github.com/pages-themes/THEME_NAME/blob/master/_layouts/default.html and replace THEME_NAME with the name of your Jekyll theme.  Copy the content of the default.html file.  Tip: Click Raw in the upper-right of the page to change your view of the file to make copying easier.

      "body": "Any user or organization on GitHub can fork a repository. Forking a repository is similar to copying another repository, with two major differences:  You can use a pull request to suggest changes from your fork to the original repository, also known as the upstream repository. You can bring changes from the upstream repository to your local fork by synchronizing your fork with the upstream repository.  Deleting a fork does not delete the original upstream repository. In fact, you can make any changes you want to your fork--add collaborators, rename files, generate GitHub Pages--with no effect on the original. In open source projects, forks are often used to iterate on ideas or changes before they are offered back to the upstream repository for everyone to benefit from. When you make changes in your fork and open a pull request that compares your work to the upstream repository, you can give anyone with push access to the upstream repository permission to push changes to your pull request branch. This speeds up collaboration by allowing repository maintainers the ability to make commits or run tests locally to your pull request branch from a fork before merging.  Private forks inherit the permissions structure of the upstream or parent repository. For example, if the upstream repository is private and gives read/write access to a team, then the same team will have read/write access to any forks of the private upstream repository. This helps owners of private repositories maintain control over their code.  Further reading  \"About collaborative development models\" \"Creating a pull request from a fork\" Open Source Guides ",

Enabling but not enforcing SAML SSO in your organization can help smooth your organization's SAML SSO adoption. Once a majority of your organization's members use SAML SSO, you can enforce it within your organization. If you enable but don't enforce SAML SSO, organization members who choose not to use SAML SSO can still be members of the organization. For more information on enforcing SAML SSO, see \"Enforcing SAML single sign-on for your organization.\"  Note: You must periodically log in to your SAML provider to authenticate and gain access to the organization's resources on GitHub. The duration of this login period is specified by your IdP and is generally 24 hours. This periodic login requirement limits the length of access and requires you to re-identify yourself to continue.  Prior to enforcing SAML SSO in your organization, ensure that you've set up your identity provider (IdP). For more information, see \"Preparing to enforce SAML single sign-on in your organization.\"  Note: Outside collaborators aren't required to have an external (SAML) identity to access an organization that uses SAML SSO.

Note: After enabling SAML SSO, you can download your single sign-on recovery codes so that you can access your organization even if your IdP is unavailable. For more information, see \"Downloading your organization's SAML single sign-on recovery codes.\"   In the \"Sign on URL\" field, type the HTTPS endpoint of your IdP for single sign-on requests. This value is available in your IdP configuration.  Optionally, in the \"Issuer\" field, type your SAML issuer's name. This verifies the authenticity of sent messages.   Under \"Public Certificate,\" paste a certificate to sign SAML responses before they're sent.   Click  and then in the Signature Method and Digest Method drop-downs, choose the hashing algorithm used by your SAML issuer to verify the integrity of the requests.    Before enabling SAML SSO for your organization, click Test SAML configuration to ensure that the information you've entered is correct.   Tip: When setting up SAML SSO in your organization, you can test your implementation without affecting your organization members by leaving Require SAML SSO authentication for all members of the organization name organization unchecked.

Follow the sequence of steps to bring down the proposed pull request.     Modifying an inactive pull request locally An inactive pull request is one whose owner has either stopped responding, or, more likely, has deleted their fork. If a fork was deleted, the pull request can still be merged. However, if you want to make changes to a pull request and the author is not responding, you'll need to perform some additional steps to update the pull request. Once a pull request is opened, GitHub stores all of the changes online for you. In other words, commits in a pull request are available in a repository even before the PR is merged. That means you can fetch an open pull request and recreate it as your own. Anyone can work with a previously opened pull request to continue working on it, test it out, or even open a new pull request with additional changes. However, only collaborators with push access can merge pull requests.  Under your repository name, click  Issues or  Pull requests.  In the \"Pull Requests\" list, click the pull request you'd like to merge. Find the ID number of the inactive pull request. This is the sequence of digits right after the pull request's title.

Files with a .json extension are also supported, but only if type is set to FeatureCollection, GeometryCollection, or topology. Then, navigate to the path of the geoJSON file on GitHub.com. When you click the paper icon on the right, you'll also see the changes made to that file as part of a commit.   Geometry Types Maps on GitHub use Leaflet.js and support all the geometry types outlined in the geoJSON spec (Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString, MultiPolygon, and GeometryCollection). TopoJSON files should be type \"Topology\" and adhere to the topoJSON spec.  Styling features You can customize the way features are displayed, such as specifying a particular color or adding a descriptive icon, by passing additional metadata within the geoJSON object's properties. The options are:   marker-size - small, medium, or large   marker-color - valid RGB hex color  marker-symbol - an icon ID from the Maki project or a single alphanumeric character (a-z or 0-9).  stroke - color of a polygon edge or line (RGB)  stroke-opacity - opacity of a polygon edge or line (0.0 - 1.0)  stroke-width - width of a polygon edge or line  fill - the color of the interior of a polygon (GRB)  fill-opacity - the opacity of the interior of a polygon (0.0-1.0)  See version 1.1.0 of the open simplestyle spec for more information.  Embedding your map elsewhere Want to make your geoJSON map available someplace other than GitHub? Simply modify this template, and place it in any HTML page that supports javascript (e.g., GitHub Pages): &lt;script src=\"https://embed.github.com/view/geojson/&lt;username&gt;/&lt;repo&gt;/&lt;ref&gt;/&lt;path_to_file&gt;\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;  For example, if your map's URL is github.com/benbalter/dc-wifi-social/blob/master/bars.geojson, your embed code would be: &lt;script src=\"https://embed.github.com/view/geojson/benbalter/dc-wifi-social/master/bars.geojson\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;  By default, the embedded map 420px x 620px, but you can customize the output by passing height and width variables as parameters at the end, such as ?height=300&amp;width=500.  Note: ref can be a branch (like master), or the hash to an individual commit (like 2391ae).   Clustering If your map contains a large number of markers (roughly over 750), GitHub will automatically cluster nearby markers at higher zoom levels. Simply click the cluster or zoom in to see individual markers.  Something's up with the underlying map The underlying map data (street names, roads, etc.) are driven by OpenStreetMap, a collaborative project to create a free editable map of the world. If you notice something's not quite right, since it's open source, simply sign up and submit a fix.  Troubleshooting If you're having trouble rendering geoJSON files, ensure you have a valid geoJSON file by running it through a geoJSON linter. If your points aren't appearing where you'd expect (e.g., in the middle of the ocean), it's likely that the data is in a projection which is currently unsupported. Currently, GitHub only supports the urn:ogc:def:crs:OGC:1.3:CRS84 projection. Additionally, if your .geojson file is especially large (over 10 MB), it is not possible to render within the browser. If that's the case, you'll generally see a message that looks something like this:  It may still be possible to render the data by converting the .geojson file to TopoJSON, a compression format that, in some cases, can reduce filesize by up to 80%. Of course, you can always break the file into smaller chunks (such as by state or by year), and store the data as multiple files within the repository.

      "body": "There are two main types of development models with which you'd use pull requests. In the fork and pull model, anyone can fork an existing repository and push changes to their personal fork without needing access to the source repository. The changes can be pulled into the source repository by the project maintainer. When you open a pull request proposing changes from your fork's branch to a branch in the source (upstream) repository, you can allow anyone with push access to the upstream repository to make changes to your pull request. This model is popular with open source projects as it reduces the amount of friction for new contributors and allows people to work independently without upfront coordination.  Tip: For more information on open source, specifically how to create and grow an open source project, we've created Open Source Guides that will help you foster a healthy open source community.  In the shared repository model, collaborators are granted push access to a single shared repository and topic branches are created when changes need to be made. Pull requests are useful in this model as they initiate code review and general discussion about a set of changes before the changes are merged into the main development branch. This model is more prevalent with small teams and organizations collaborating on private projects.

      "body": "Millions of developers host millions of projects on GitHub — both open and closed source — and we're honored to play a part in enabling collaboration across the community every day. Together, we all have an exciting opportunity and responsibility to make this a community we can be proud of. GitHub users worldwide bring wildly different perspectives, ideas, and experiences, and range from people who created their first \"Hello World\" project last week to the most well-known software developers in the world. We are committed to making GitHub a welcoming environment for all the different voices and perspectives in our community, while maintaining a space where people are free to express themselves. We rely on our community members to communicate expectations, moderate their projects, and report abusive behavior or content. We do not actively seek out content to moderate. By outlining what we expect to see within our community, we hope to help you understand how best to collaborate on GitHub, and what type of actions or content may violate our Terms of Service. We will investigate any abuse reports and may moderate public content on our site that we determine to be in violation of our Terms of Service.  Building a strong community The primary purpose of the GitHub community is to collaborate on software projects. We want people to work better together. Although we maintain the site, this is a community we build together, and we need your help to make it the best it can be.  Be welcoming and open-minded - Other collaborators may not have the same experience level or background as you, but that doesn't mean they don't have good ideas to contribute. We encourage you to be welcoming to new collaborators on your projects and discussions. Assume no malice - Humans make mistakes, and disagreements or differences of opinion are a fact of life. Try to approach conflict from the perspective that people generally mean well. This will promote a respectful and friendly atmosphere where people feel comfortable asking questions, participating in discussions, and making contributions. Stay on topic - People use GitHub to get work done and to be more productive. Off topic comments are a distraction (sometimes welcome, but usually not) from getting work done and being productive. Staying on topic helps produce positive and productive discussions. Be clear - Communicating with strangers on the Internet can be awkward. It's hard to convey or read tone, and sarcasm is frequently misunderstood. Try to use clear language, and think about how it will be received by the other person.   What if something or someone offends you? We rely on the community to let us know when an issue needs to be addressed. We do not actively monitor the site for offensive content. If you run into something or someone on the site that you find objectionable, here are some tools GitHub provides to help you take action immediately:  Communicate expectations - If you participate in a community that has not set their own, community-specific guidelines, encourage them to do so either in the README or CONTRIBUTING file, or in a dedicated code of conduct, by submitting a pull request. Moderate Comments - If you have write-access privileges for a repository, you can edit or delete anyone's comments on commits, pull requests, and issues. Lock Conversations - If a discussion in an issue or pull request gets out of control, you can lock the conversation. Block Users - If you encounter a user who continues to demonstrate poor behavior, you can block the user from your personal account or block the user from your organization.  Of course, you can always contact us to Report Abuse if you need more help dealing with a situation.  What is not allowed? We are committed to maintaining a community where users are free to express themselves and challenge one another's ideas, both technical and otherwise. Such discussions, however, are unlikely to foster fruitful dialog when ideas are silenced because community members are being shouted down or are afraid to speak up. That means you should be respectful and civil at all times, and refrain from attacking others on the basis of who they are. We do not tolerate behavior that crosses the line into the following:  Threats of violence - You may not threaten violence towards others or use the site to organize, promote, or incite acts of real-world violence or terrorism. Think carefully about the words you use, the images you post, and even the software you write, and how they may be interpreted by others. Even if you mean something as a joke, it might not be received that way. If you think that someone else might interpret the content you post as a threat, or as promoting violence or terrorism, stop. Don't post it on GitHub. In extraordinary cases, we may report threats of violence to law enforcement if we think there may be a genuine risk of physical harm or a threat to public safety. Hate speech and discrimination - While it is not forbidden to broach topics such as age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation, we do not tolerate speech that attacks a person or group of people on the basis of who they are. Just realize that when approached in an aggressive or insulting manner, these (and other) sensitive topics can make others feel unwelcome, or perhaps even unsafe. While there's always the potential for misunderstandings, we expect our community members to remain respectful and civil when discussing sensitive topics. Bullying and harassment - We do not tolerate bullying or harassment. This means any habitual badgering or intimidation targeted at a specific person or group of people. In general, if your actions are unwanted and you continue to engage in them, there's a good chance you are headed into bullying or harassment territory. Impersonation - You may not seek to mislead others as to your identity by copying another person's avatar, posting content under their email address, using a similar username or otherwise posing as someone else. Impersonation is a form of harassment. Doxxing and invasion of privacy - Don't post other people's personal information, such as phone numbers, private email addresses, physical addresses, credit card numbers, Social Security/National Identity numbers, or passwords. Depending on the context, such as in the case of intimidation or harassment, we may consider other information, such as photos or videos that were taken or distributed without the subject's consent, to be an invasion of privacy, especially when such material presents a safety risk to the subject. Sexually obscene content - Basically, don't post pornography. This does not mean that all nudity or sexual content is prohibited. We recognize that sexuality is a part of life and non-pornographic sexual content may be a part of your project, or may be presented for educational or artistic purposes. If you have any questions or concerns about something you want to post, feel free to reach out and ask beforehand. Active malware or exploits - Being part of a community includes not taking advantage of other members of the community. We do not allow anyone to use our platform for exploit delivery, such as using GitHub as a means to deliver malicious executables, or as attack infrastructure, for example by organizing denial of service attacks or managing command and control servers. Note, however, that we do not prohibit the posting of source code which could be used to develop malware or exploits, as the publication and distribution of such source code has educational value and provides a net benefit to the security community.   What happens if someone breaks the rules? There are a variety of actions that we may take when a user reports inappropriate behavior or content. It usually depends on the exact circumstances of a particular case. We recognize that sometimes people may say or do inappropriate things for any number of reasons. Perhaps they did not realize how their words would be perceived. Or maybe they just let their emotions get the best of them. Of course, sometimes, there are folks who just want to spam or cause trouble. Each case requires a different approach, and we try to tailor our response to meet the needs of the situation that has been reported. We'll review each abuse report on a case-by-case basis. In each case, we will have a diverse team investigate the content and surrounding facts and respond as appropriate, using these guidelines to guide our decision. Actions we may take in response to an abuse report include but are not limited to:  Content Removal Content Blocking Account Suspension Account Termination   Legal Notices We dedicate these Community Guidelines to the public domain for anyone to use, reuse, adapt, or whatever, under the terms of CC0-1.0. These are only guidelines; they do not modify our Terms of Service and are not intended to be a complete list. GitHub retains full discretion under the Terms of Service to remove any content or terminate any accounts for activity that violates our Terms on Acceptable Use. These guidelines describe when we will exercise that discretion.",

Tags mark a specific point in the history of your project, so they're a great way to indicate a Release. Releases are ordered by a tag's date in the following way:  If it's an annotated tag, the tag object's date is used. If it's a lightweight tag, then the commit object's date is used.

For information on how to resolve these situations, see \"Competing line change merge conflicts and \"Removed file merge conflicts.\"  Competing line change merge conflicts To resolve a merge conflict caused by competing line changes, you must choose which changes to incorporate from the different branches in a new commit. For example, if you and another person both edited the file styleguide.md on the same lines in different branches of the same Git repository, you'll get a merge conflict error when you try to merge these branches. You must resolve this merge conflict with a new commit before you can merge these branches.  Open TerminalTerminalGit Bash.  Navigate into the local Git repository that has the merge conflict.  cd REPOSITORY-NAME    Generate a list of the files affected by the merge conflict. In this example, the file styleguide.md has a merge conflict.  git status # On branch branch-b # You have unmerged paths. # (fix conflicts and run \"git commit\") # # Unmerged paths: # (use \"git add ...\" to mark resolution) # # both modified: styleguide.md # no changes added to commit (use \"git add\" and/or \"git commit -a\")   Open your favorite text editor, such as Atom, and navigate to the file that has merge conflicts.  To see the beginning of the merge conflict in your file, search the file for the conflict marker &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;. When you open the file in your text editor, you'll see the changes from the HEAD or base branch after the line &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD. Next, you'll see =======, which divides your changes from the changes in the other branch, followed by &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BRANCH-NAME. In this example, one person wrote \"open an issue\" in the base or HEAD branch and another person wrote \"ask your question in IRC\" in the compare branch or branch-a. If you have questions, please &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD open an issue ======= ask your question in IRC. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; branch-a    Decide if you want to keep only your branch's changes, keep only the other branch's changes, or make a brand new change, which may incorporate changes from both branches. Delete the conflict markers &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;, =======, &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and make the changes you want in the final merge. In this example, both changes are incorporated into the final merge: If you have questions, please open an issue or ask in our IRC channel if it's more urgent.    Add or stage your changes.  git add .    Commit your changes with a comment.  git commit -m \"Resolved merge conflict by incorporating both suggestions.\"    You can now merge the branches on the command line or push your changes to your remote repository on GitHub and merge your changes in a pull request.  Removed file merge conflicts To resolve a merge conflict caused by competing changes to a file, where a person deletes a file in one branch and another person edits the same file, you must choose whether to delete or keep the removed file in a new commit. For example, if you edited a file, such as README.md, and another person removed the same file in another branch in the same Git repository, you'll get a merge conflict error when you try to merge these branches. You must resolve this merge conflict with a new commit before you can merge these branches.  Open TerminalTerminalGit Bash.  Navigate into the local Git repository that has the merge conflict.  cd REPOSITORY-NAME    Generate a list of the files affected by the merge conflict. In this example, the file README.md has a merge conflict.  git status # On branch master # Your branch and 'origin/master' have diverged, # and have 1 and 2 different commits each, respectively. # (use \"git pull\" to merge the remote branch into yours) # You have unmerged paths. # (fix conflicts and run \"git commit\") # # Unmerged paths: # (use \"git add/rm ...\" as appropriate to mark resolution) # # deleted by us: README.md # # no changes added to commit (use \"git add\" and/or \"git commit -a\")   Open your favorite text editor, such as Atom, and navigate to the file that has merge conflicts.  Decide if you want keep the removed file. You may want to view the latest changes made to the removed file in your text editor. To add the removed file back to your repository:  git add README.md  To remove this file from your repository:  git rm README.md README.md: needs merge rm 'README.md'    Commit your changes with a comment.  git commit -m \"Resolved merge conflict by keeping README.md file.\" [branch-d 6f89e49] Merge branch 'branch-c' into branch-d    You can now merge the branches on the command line or push your changes to your remote repository on GitHub and merge your changes in a pull request.

      "body": " GitHub doesn't have any set disk quotas. We try to provide abundant storage for all Git repositories, within reason. Keeping repositories small ensures that our servers are fast and downloads are quick for our users.   Tip: If you regularly push large files to GitHub, consider introducing Git Large File Storage (Git LFS) as part of your workflow. Git LFS works well with the GitHub Flow and can be used with any large file, regardless of its type. For more information, see \"Versioning large files.\"   File and repository size limitations We recommend repositories be kept under 1GB each. This limit is easy to stay within if large files are kept out of the repository. If your repository exceeds 1GB, you might receive a polite email from GitHub Support requesting that you reduce the size of the repository to bring it back down. In addition, we place a strict limit of files exceeding 100 MB in size. For more information, see \"Working with large files.\"  Note: If you add a file to a repository via a browser, the file can be no larger than 25 MB. For more information, see \"Adding a file to a repository\".   Backups Git is not adequately designed to serve as a backup tool. However, there are many solutions specifically designed for performing backups that are worth checking out, including Arq, Carbonite, Mozy and CrashPlan.  Database dumps Large SQL files do not play well with version control systems such as Git. If you are looking to provide your developers with the most recent production dataset, we recommend using Dropbox for sharing files like these among your developers. If you are looking to backup your production servers, see the Backups section above.  External dependencies Another thing that causes Git repositories to become large and bloated are external dependencies. It's best to leave these files out of the repository and use a package manager instead. Most popular languages come with package managers that can do this for you. Bundler, Node's Package Manager and Maven. They each support using a Git repository directly as well, so you don't need pre-packaged sources.  Packaged release versions We don't recommend distributing compiled code and pre-packaged releases within your repository. For more information on sharing large files, see \"Distributing large binaries.\"  Changing history of an existing repository If you already have a repository that's quite large, don't fret! You can remove large files from the repository's history to reduce its size. For more information, see \"Removing files from a repository's history.\"",

      "body": " Creating a strong password  Your security on GitHub, as well as every other account you have on the Web, is best served with a strong password that isn't shared with any other person, service, or site.  Updating your GitHub access credentials  GitHub credentials include not only your password, but also the access tokens, SSH keys, and application API tokens you use to communicate with GitHub. Should you have the need, you can reset all of these access credentials yourself.  Creating a personal access token for the command line  You can create a personal access token and use it in place of a password when performing Git operations over HTTPS with Git on the command line or the API.  Reviewing your SSH keys  To keep your credentials secure, you should regularly audit your SSH keys, deploy keys, and review authorized applications that access your GitHub account.  Reviewing your deploy keys  You should review deploy keys to ensure that there aren't any unauthorized (or possibly compromised) keys. You can also approve existing deploy keys that are valid.  Reviewing your authorized applications (OAuth)  You should review your authorized applications to verify that no new applications with expansive permissions are authorized, such as those that have access to your private repositories.  Reviewing your security log  You can review your account's security log to better understand the actions you've performed in the last 90 days.  Removing sensitive data from a repository  If you commit sensitive data, such as a password or SSH key into a Git repository, you can remove it from the history. To entirely remove unwanted files from a repository's history you can use either the git filter-branch command or the BFG Repo-Cleaner.  About anonymized image URLs  If you upload an image to GitHub, the URL of the image will be modified so your information is not trackable.  GitHub's IP addresses  To make sure you have access to all of our services, you should ensure that you've whitelisted the GitHub IP address range.  GitHub's SSH key fingerprints  Public key fingerprints can be used to validate a connection to a remote server.  Sudo mode  GitHub asks you for your password before you can modify your email address, authorize third-party applications, or add new public keys, or initiate other sudo-protected actions.  Preventing unauthorized access  You may be alerted to a security incident in the media, such as the discovery of the Heartbleed bug, or your computer could be stolen while you're signed in to GitHub. In such cases, changing your password prevents any unintended future access to your account and projects.",

To learn more about the different types of GitHub Pages sites, see \"User, organization, and project pages.\" You can create and publish GitHub Pages online using the Jekyll Theme Chooser. If you prefer to work locally, you can use GitHub Desktop or the command line. GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service and doesn't support server-side code such as, PHP, Ruby, or Python.  Guidelines for using GitHub Pages  GitHub Pages sites created after June 15, 2016 and using github.io domains are served over HTTPS. If you created your site before June 15, 2016, you can enable HTTPS support for traffic to your site. GitHub Pages sites shouldn't be used for sensitive transactions like sending passwords or credit card numbers. Your use of GitHub Pages is subject to the GitHub Terms of Service, including the prohibition on reselling.   Warning: GitHub Pages sites are publicly available on the internet, even if their repositories are private. If you have sensitive data in your Page repository, you may want to remove it before publishing.   Usage limits GitHub Pages sites are subject to the following usage limits:  GitHub Pages source repositories have a recommended limit of 1GB . Published GitHub Pages sites may be no larger than 1 GB. GitHub Pages sites have a soft bandwidth limit of 100GB per month. GitHub Pages sites have a soft limit of 10 builds per hour.  If your site exceeds these usage quotas, we may not be able to serve your site, or you may receive a polite email from GitHub Support suggesting strategies for reducing your site's impact on our servers, including putting a third-party content distribution network (CDN) in front of your site, making use of other GitHub features, such as releases, or moving to a different hosting service that might better fit your needs. Additionally, GitHub Pages sites must refrain from:  Content or activity that is illegal or otherwise prohibited by our Terms of Service or Community Guidelines  Violent or threatening content or activity Excessive automated bulk activity (for example, spamming) Activity that compromises GitHub users or GitHub services Get-rich-quick schemes Sexually obscene content Content that misrepresents your identity or site purpose  If you have questions about whether your use or intended use falls into these categories, please contact GitHub Support.

Check your Git version There's no minimum Git version necessary to interact with GitHub, but we've found version 1.7.10 to be a comfortable stable version that's available on many platforms. You can always download the latest version on the Git website.  Ensure the remote is correct The repository you're trying to fetch must exist on GitHub, and the URL is case-sensitive. You can find the URL of the local repository by opening the command line and typing git remote -v:  git remote -v # View existing remotes origin https://github.com/github/reactivecocoa.git (fetch) origin https://github.com/github/reactivecocoa.git (push) git remote set-url origin https://github.com/github/ReactiveCocoa.git # Change the 'origin' remote's URL git remote -v # Verify new remote URL origin https://github.com/github/ReactiveCocoa.git (fetch) origin https://github.com/github/ReactiveCocoa.git (push)  Alternatively, you can change the URL through our GitHub Desktop application.  Provide an access token If you have enabled two-factor authentication, or if you are accessing an organization that uses SAML single sign-on, you must provide a personal access token instead of entering your password for HTTPS Git.  Check your permissions When prompted for a username and password, make sure you use an account that has access to the repository.  Tip: If you don't want to enter your username and password every time you interact with the remote repository, you can turn on password caching.

      "body": " Directory structure Each reference, or labeled snapshot of a commit, in a project is organized within specific subdirectories, such as trunk, branches, and tags. For example, an SVN project with two features under development might look like this:  sample_project/trunk/README.md sample_project/trunk/lib/widget.rb sample_project/branches/new_feature/README.md sample_project/branches/new_feature/lib/widget.rb sample_project/branches/another_new_feature/README.md sample_project/branches/another_new_feature/lib/widget.rb  An SVN workflow looks like this:  The trunk directory represents the latest stable release of a project. Active feature work is developed within subdirectories under branches. When a feature is finished, the feature directory is merged into trunk and removed.  Git projects are also stored within a single directory. However, Git obscures the details of its references by storing them in a special .git directory. For example, a Git project with two features under development might look like this:  sample_project/.git sample_project/README.md sample_project/lib/widget.rb  A Git workflow looks like this:  A Git repository stores the full history of all of its branches and tags within the .git directory. The latest stable release is contained within the master branch. Active feature work is developed in separate branches. When a feature is finished, the feature branch is merged into master and deleted.  Unlike SVN, with Git the directory structure remains the same, but the contents of the files change based on your branch.  Including subprojects A subproject is a project that's developed and managed somewhere outside of your main project. You typically import a subproject to add some functionality to your project without needing to maintain the code yourself. Whenever the subproject is updated, you can synchronize it with your project to ensure that everything is up-to-date. In SVN, a subproject is called an SVN external. In Git, it's called a Git submodule. Although conceptually similar, Git submodules are not kept up-to-date automatically; you must explicitly ask for a new version to be brought into your project. Here are some external resources that explain the differences in more detail:  Understanding Git Submodules Git Tools Submodules   Preserving history SVN is configured to assume that the history of a project never changes. Git allows you to modify previous commits and changes using tools like git rebase.  GitHub supports Subversion clients, which may produce some unexpected results if you're using both Git and SVN on the same project. If you've manipulated Git's commit history, those same commits will always remain within SVN's history. If you accidentally committed some sensitive data, we have an article that will help you remove it from Git's history.

      "body": " When searching GitHub, you can construct queries that match specific numbers and words.   Query for values greater than another value Suppose you want to find all instances of the word \"cat\" in repository descriptions that have been starred 10 or more times by GitHub users. You can construct a few different kinds of queries:   You can use &gt; or &gt;= to indicate \"greater than\" and \"greater than or equal to,\" respectively. For example, the following search queries are equivalent:  cats stars:\"&gt;10\" cats stars:\"&gt;= 11\"  You can also use the &gt; or &gt;= symbols to search on dates. Date formatting must follow the ISO8601 standard, which is YYYY-MM-DD--that's year-month-day. You may also add some optional time information, formatted as THH:MM:SS+07:00--that's hour-minutes-seconds (HH:MM:SS), followed by a UTC offset (+07:00) The following queries search for issues created after April 30th, 2012 containing the word \"cats\":  cats created:&gt;=2012-04-30 cats created:&gt;2012-04-29    The more programmatic &lt;number&gt; .. * notation is equivalent to &gt;= &lt;number&gt;. The .. notation is called a range query. You can define range queries that are greater than a certain number. For example, the following syntax means \"greater than or equal to 10\":  cats stars:\"10 .. *\"  The following syntax finds issues created after April 30th, 2012 containing the word \"cats\":  cats created:\"2012-04-30 .. * \"  The advantage of the .. notation is that you can add an upper boundary by replacing the * with another number. For example, the following syntax means \"greater than or equal to 10, but less than or equal to 50\":  cats stars:\"10 .. 50\"  The following syntax finds issues created after April 30th, 2012 but before July 4th, 2012 containing the word \"cats\":  cats created:\"2012-04-30 .. 2012-07-04\"    Both of these operands can use any number or date range.  Query for values less than another value What if you're interested in the least popular \"cats\" repositories? The syntax to find these is similar:   You can use &lt; and &lt;= to indicate \"less than\" and \"less than or equal to,\" respectively. For example, the following search queries are equivalent:  cats stars:\"&lt;10\" cats stars:\"&lt;= 9\"  You can also use the &lt; or &lt;= symbols to search on dates. Date formatting must follow the ISO8601 standard, which is YYYY-MM-DD--that's year-month-day. You may also add some optional time information, formatted as THH:MM:SS+07:00--that's hour-minutes-seconds (HH:MM:SS), followed by a UTC offset (+07:00) The following queries search for issues created before July 4th, 2012 containing the word \"cats\":  cats created:&lt;2012-07-05 cats created:&lt;=2012-07-04    The more programmatic * .. &lt;number&gt; notation is equivalent to &lt;= &lt;number&gt;. The .. notation is called a range query. You can define range queries that are less than a certain number. For example, the following syntax means \"less than or equal to 10\":  cats stars:\"* .. 10\"  The following syntax finds issues created before July 4th, 2012 containing the word \"cats\":  cats created:\"* .. 2012-04-30\"  The advantage of the .. notation is that you can can add a lower boundary by replacing the * with another number. For example, the following syntax means \"greater than or equal to 1, but less than or equal to 10\":  cats stars:\"1 .. 10\"  The following syntax finds issues created after April 30th, 2012 but before July 4th, 2012 containing the word \"cats\":  cats created:\"2012-04-30 .. 2012-07-04\"    Both of these operands can use any number or date range.  Query for values between a range The power of range queries come when you're looking for strictly non-numerical data. Let's say you're looking for \"cats\" repositories that were last updated between the end of April and July 4th of 2012. The syntax would look like this:  cats pushed:\"2012-04-30 .. 2012-07-04\"  You can't search for a period of time using the &gt;= and &lt;= notation.  Exclude results containing a certain word You can also narrow your search results by excluding words with the NOT syntax. Searching for Hello returns a massive number of \"Hello World\" projects, but changing your search to include hello NOT world returns fewer results. The NOT operator can only be used for string keywords. It does not work for numerals or dates.  Filter qualifiers based on exclusion Another way you can narrow down search results is to exclude certain subsets. Prefixing any search qualifier with a - excludes all results that are matched by that qualifier. For example, you might be interested in finding all \"cats\" repositories with more than 10 stars that are not written in JavaScript:  cats stars:&gt;10 -language:javascript  You might also want to find all issues mentioning @defunkt that are not in repositories in the GitHub organization:  mentions:defunkt -user:github   Omit quotation marks and spaces in queries If you prefer a more compact notation, you can omit the quotations and the spaces for any of these criteria. Quotations need to be included only if the query contains whitespace. For example:  cats stars:&gt;10 cats created:2012-04-30..2012-07-04 cats NOT \"hello world\" ",

For more information, see \"Jekyll on Windows\" in the official Jekyll documentation.   Requirements We recommend using Bundler to install and run Jekyll. Bundler manages Ruby gem dependencies, reduces Jekyll build errors, and prevents environment-related bugs. To install Bundler, you must install Ruby.  Open TerminalTerminalGit Bash.  Check whether you have Ruby 2.1.0 or higher installed:  ruby --version ruby 2.X.X   If you don't have Ruby installed, install Ruby 2.1.0 or higher.  Install Bundler:  gem install bundler # Installs the Bundler gem   If you already have a local repository for your Jekyll site, skip to Step 2.   Step 1: Create a local repository for your Jekyll site  If you haven't already downloaded Git, install it. For more information, see \"Set up Git.\" Open TerminalTerminalGit Bash.  On your local computer, initialize a new Git repository for your Jekyll site:  git init JEKYLL-SITE-REPOSITORY-NAME Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/octocat/my-site/.git/ # Creates a new file directory on your local computer, initialized as a Git repository    Change directories to the new repository you created:  cd JEKYLL-SITE-REPOSITORY-NAME # Changes the working directory    If your new local repository is for a Project pages site, create a new gh-pages branch:  Note: You can skip this step if you would rather use the master branch for your Project Page. If you haven't checked out any branches, once you make a commit in your local repository, your change will appear on the master branch by default.   git checkout -b gh-pages Switched to a new branch 'gh-pages' # Creates a new branch called 'gh-pages', and checks it out   Tip: To learn more about creating a User, Organization or Project Page and which branch to use, see \"User, Organization, and Project Pages.\" To learn more about how to build your site's source files from a /docs folder on the master branch, see \"Configuring a publishing source for GitHub Pages.\"     Step 2: Install Jekyll using Bundler To track your site's dependencies, Ruby will use the contents of your Gemfile to build your Jekyll site.   Check to see if you have a Gemfile in your local Jekyll site repository:  ls Gemfile  If you have a Gemfile, skip to step 4. If you don't have a Gemfile, skip to step 2.   If you don't have a Gemfile, open your favorite text editor, such as Atom, and add these lines to a new file:  source 'https://rubygems.org' gem 'github-pages', group: :jekyll_plugins   Name the file Gemfile and save it to the root directory of your local Jekyll site repository. Skip to step 5 to install Jekyll.  If you already have a Gemfile, open your favorite text editor, such as Atom, and add these lines to your Gemfile:  source 'https://rubygems.org' gem 'github-pages', group: :jekyll_plugins    Install Jekyll and other dependencies from the GitHub Pages gem:  bundle install Fetching gem metadata from https://rubygems.org/............ Fetching version metadata from https://rubygems.org/... Fetching dependency metadata from https://rubygems.org/.. Resolving dependencies...    Tip: If you see a Ruby error when you try to install Jekyll using Bundler, you may need to use a package manager, such as RVM or Homebrew, to manage your Ruby installation. For more information, see Jekyll's troubleshooting page.      Step 3 (optional): Generate Jekyll site files To build your Jekyll site locally, preview your site changes, and troubleshoot build errors, you must have Jekyll site files on your local computer. You may already have Jekyll site files on your local computer if you cloned a Jekyll site repository. If you don't have a Jekyll site downloaded, you can generate Jekyll site files for a basic Jekyll template site in your local repository. If you want to use an existing Jekyll site repository on GitHub as the starting template for your Jekyll site, fork and clone the Jekyll site repository on GitHub to your local computer. For more information, see \"Fork a repo.\"  Note: As of Jekyll 3.2, the default Jekyll site contains a Gemfile that locks Jekyll to the Gem version you build it with. To instead lock it to the version used by GitHub Pages, you'll uncomment the gem \"github-pages\", group: :jekyll_plugins line in the steps below.    If you don't already have a Jekyll site on your local computer, create a Jekyll template site in a new directory:  jekyll _3.3.0_ new NEW-JEKYLL-SITE-REPOSITORY-NAME New jekyll site installed in /Users/octocat/NEW-JEKYLL-SITE-REPOSITORY-NAME.    Navigate into your new site directory:  cd NEW-JEKYLL-SITE-REPOSITORY-NAME    Edit your Gemfile and remove the following line:  \"jekyll\", \"3.3.0\"    In the Gemfile, delete the # at the beginning of this line:  gem \"github-pages\", group: :jekyll_plugins    Initialize your site directory as a Git repository.  git init Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/octocat/name-of-your-directory    Connect your remote repository on GitHub to your local repository for your GitHub Pages site.  git remote add origin https://github.com/username-or-organization-name/your-remote-repository-name   To edit the Jekyll template site, open your new Jekyll site files in a text editor. Make your changes and save them in the text editor. You can preview these changes locally on your computer without committing your changes using Git by running a Jekyll command to build your site.  Add or stage your changes.  git add .    Commit your changes with a comment.  git commit -m \"updated site\"    To publish your changes on your GitHub Pages site, push your changes to your remote repository on GitHub.  git push -u origin master    For more information on using this Git workflow, see \"Good Resources for Learning Git and GitHub\" or see this Git cheat sheet.  Step 4: Build your local Jekyll site  Navigate into the root directory of your local Jekyll site repository.  Run your Jekyll site locally:  bundle exec jekyll serve Configuration file: /Users/octocat/my-site/_config.yml  Source: /Users/octocat/my-site  Destination: /Users/octocat/my-site/_site Incremental build: disabled. Enable with --incremental  Generating...  done in 0.309 seconds. Auto-regeneration: enabled for '/Users/octocat/my-site' Configuration file: /Users/octocat/my-site/_config.yml  Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000/  Server running... press ctrl-c to stop.   Preview your local Jekyll site in your web browser at http://localhost:4000.   Keeping your site up to date with the GitHub Pages gem Jekyll is an active open source project and is updated frequently. As the GitHub Pages server is updated, the software on your computer may become out of date, resulting in your site appearing different locally from how it looks when published on GitHub.  Open TerminalTerminalGit Bash.  Run this update command:  If you followed our setup recommendations and installed Bundler, run bundle update github-pages or simply bundle update and all your gems will update to the latest versions. If you don't have Bundler installed, run gem update github-pages      Next steps: Configuring Jekyll To configure your pages site further, see \"Configuring Jekyll.\" To set up a project pages site, see Jekyll's official documentation on project pages URLs.

File views show the latest version on a branch When viewing a file on GitHub, you usually see the version at the current head of a branch. For example:  https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/master/README.md  refers to GitHub's hubot repository, and shows the master branch's current version of the README.md file. The version of a file at the head of branch can change as new commits are made, so if you were to copy the normal URL, the file contents might not be the same when someone looks at it later.  Press y to permalink to a file in a specific commit For a permanent link to the specific version of a file that you see, instead of using a branch name in the URL (i.e. the master part in the example above), put a commit id. This will permanently link to the exact version of the file in that commit. For example:  https://github.com/github/hubot/blob/ed25584f5ac2520a6c28547ffd0961c7abd7ea49/README.md  replaces master with a specific commit id and the file content will not change. Looking up the commit SHA by hand is inconvenient, however, so as a shortcut you can type y to automatically update the URL to the permalink version. Then you can copy the URL knowing that anyone you share it with will see exactly what you saw.  Tip: You can put any identifier that can be resolved to a commit in the URL, including branch names, specific commit SHAs, or tags!   Further reading  \"Archiving a GitHub repository\" ",

      "body": " You can enforce HTTPS to add a layer of encryption for traffic to your GitHub Pages site if it has a github.io domain.  With HTTPS enforcement enabled, HTTP requests to your GitHub Pages site will be transparently redirected to HTTPS. HTTPS enforcement is required for GitHub Pages sites created after June 15, 2016 and using a github.io domain. If you created your GitHub Pages site before June 15, 2016, you can manually enable HTTPS enforcement. HTTPS is not supported for GitHub Pages using custom domains.  Tip: GitHub Pages sites shouldn't be used for sensitive transactions like sending passwords or credit card numbers.   On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository. Under your repository name, click  Settings.  Under \"GitHub Pages\", select Enforce HTTPS.    Resolving problems with mixed content If you enable HTTPS for your site, and your site's HTML still references images, CSS, or JavaScript over HTTP, then your site is serving mixed content, and you may have trouble loading assets. Serving mixed content also makes your site less secure. To remove your site's mixed content, improve your site's security, and resolve problems related to loading mixed content, edit your site's HTML files and change http:// to https:// so that all of your assets are served over HTTPS. For GitHub Pages sites that use Jekyll, your HTML files will most likely be stored in the _layouts folder. In general, CSS is found in the &lt;head&gt; section of your HTML file. JavaScript is usually in the &lt;head&gt; section or just before the closing &lt;/body&gt; tag. Images are often in the &lt;body&gt; section.  Tip: If you can't find where your assets are found in your site, try searching your site's code for http in your text editor or on GitHub.   Examples of how assets may be referenced in an HTML file    Asset type HTTP HTTPS     CSS &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"http://example.com/css/main.css\"&gt; &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://example.com/css/main.css\"&gt;   JavaScript &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://example.com/js/main.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://example.com/js/main.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;   Image &lt;A HREF=\"http://www.somesite.com\"&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=\"http://www.example.com/logo.jpg\" alt=\"Logo\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;A HREF=\"https://www.somesite.com\"&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=\"https://www.example.com/logo.jpg\" alt=\"Logo\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;   ",

      "body": " If you need to manage multiple projects within a single repository, you can use a subtree merge to handle all the references.  Typically, a subtree merge is used to contain a repository within a repository. The \"subrepository\" is stored in a folder of the main repository. The best way to explain subtree merges is to show by example. We will:  Make an empty repository called test that represents our project Merge another repository into it as a subtree called Spoon-Knife. The test project will use that subproject as if it were part of the same repository. Fetch updates from Spoon-Knife into our test project.   Setting up the empty repository for a subtree merge  Open TerminalTerminalGit Bash.  Create a new directory and navigate to it.  mkdir test cd test    Initialize a new Git repository.  git init Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/octocat/tmp/test/.git/    Create and commit a new file.  touch .gitignore git add .gitignore git commit -m \"initial commit\" [master (root-commit) 3146c2a] initial commit  0 files changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)  create mode 100644 .gitignore     Adding a new repository as a subtree   Add a new remote URL pointing to the separate project that we're interested in.  git remote add -f spoon-knife git@github.com:octocat/Spoon-Knife.git Updating spoon-knife warning: no common commits remote: Counting objects: 1732, done. remote: Compressing objects: 100% (750/750), done. remote: Total 1732 (delta 1086), reused 1558 (delta 967) Receiving objects: 100% (1732/1732), 528.19 KiB | 621 KiB/s, done.

Tip: If you create a fresh clone of the repository in the future, the remotes you've added will not be created for you. You will have to add them again using the git remote add command.   Synchronizing with updates and changes When a subproject is added, it is not automatically kept in sync with the upstream changes. You will need to update the subproject with the following command:  git pull -s subtree remotename branchname  For the example above, this would be:  git pull -s subtree spoon-knife master   Further reading  The \"Subtree Merging\" chapter from the Pro Git book \"How to use the subtree merge strategy\" ",

About supported custom domains  If you're setting up a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site, choose a supported custom domain for the easiest setup and more support. GitHub Pages is designed to work with two types of custom domains: apex domains and subdomains.  Custom domain redirects for GitHub Pages sites  The type of pages site you're using determines how your site redirects custom domains.  Adding or removing a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site  Before setting up your custom domain with your DNS provider you need to add a custom domain to your GitHub Pages site on GitHub.  Setting up an apex domain and www subdomain  You can set up an apex domain and a www subdomain through your DNS provider and GitHub Pages' servers will automatically create redirects between them. For example, your site can be found at www.example.com or example.com.  Setting up an apex domain  To set up an apex domain, such as example.com, you must configure an ALIAS, ANAME, or A record with your DNS provider.  Setting up a www subdomain  To set up a www subdomain, such as www.example.com you must configure a CNAME record with your DNS provider.  Setting up a custom subdomain  You can set up a custom subdomain, such as blog.example.com, by creating a CNAME record through your DNS provider.  Troubleshooting custom domains  If your GitHub Pages site isn't loading at your custom domain, you may have an error in your GitHub repository setup or your DNS configuration.",

      "url": "/articles/using-git-rebase-on-the-command-line",
      "body": " Here's a short tutorial on using git rebase on the command line.  In this example, we will cover all of the git rebase commands available, except for exec. We'll start our rebase by entering git rebase --interactive HEAD~7 on the terminal. Our favorite text editor will display the following lines: pick 1fc6c95 Patch A pick 6b2481b Patch B pick dd1475d something I want to split pick c619268 A fix for Patch B pick fa39187 something to add to patch A pick 4ca2acc i cant' typ goods pick 7b36971 something to move before patch B  In this example, we're going to:  Squash the fifth commit (fa39187) into the \"Patch A\" commit (1fc6c95), using squash. Move the last commit (7b36971) up before the \"Patch B\" commit (6b2481b), and keep it as pick. Merge the \"A fix for Patch B\" commit (c619268) into the \"Patch B\" commit (6b2481b), and disregard the commit message using fixup. Split the third commit (dd1475d) into two smaller commits, using edit. Fix the commit message of the misspelled commit (4ca2acc), using reword.  Phew! This sounds like a lot of work, but by taking it one step at a time, we can easily make those changes. To start, we'll need to modify the commands in the file to look like this: pick 1fc6c95 Patch A squash fa39187 something to add to patch A pick 7b36971 something to move before patch B pick 6b2481b Patch B fixup c619268 A fix for Patch B edit dd1475d something I want to split reword 4ca2acc i cant' typ goods  We've changed each line's command from pick to the command we're interested in. Now, save and close the editor; this will start the interactive rebase. Git skips the first rebase command, pick 1fc6c95, since it doesn't need to do anything. It goes to the next command, squash fa39187. Since this operation requires your input, Git opens your text editor once again. The file it opens up looks something like this: # This is a combination of two commits. # The first commit's message is: Patch A # This is the 2nd commit message: something to add to patch A # Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting # with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit. # Not currently on any branch. # Changes to be committed: # (use \"git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;...\" to unstage) # # modified: a #  This file is Git's way of saying, \"Hey, here's what I'm about to do with this squash.\" It lists the first commit's message (\"Patch A\"), and the second commit's message (\"something to add to patch A\"). If you're happy with these commit messages, you can save the file, and close the editor. Otherwise, you have the option of changing the commit message by simply changing the text. When the editor is closed, the rebase continues: pick 1fc6c95 Patch A squash fa39187 something to add to patch A pick 7b36971 something to move before patch B pick 6b2481b Patch B fixup c619268 A fix for Patch B edit dd1475d something I want to split reword 4ca2acc i cant' typ goods  Git processes the two pick commands (for pick 7b36971 and pick 6b2481b). It also processes the fixup command (fixup c619268), since it doesn't require any interaction. fixup merges the changes from c619268 into the commit before it, 6b2481b. Both changes will have the same commit message: \"Patch B\". Git gets to the edit dd1475d operation, stops, and prints the following message to the terminal:  You can amend the commit now, with git commit --amend Once you are satisfied with your changes, run git rebase --continue  At this point, you can edit any of the files in your project to make any additional changes. For each change you make, you'll need to perform a new commit, and you can do that by entering the git commit --amend command. When you're finished making all your changes, you can run git rebase --continue. Git then gets to the reword 4ca2acc command. It opens up your text editor one more time, and presents the following information: i cant' typ goods # Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting # with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit. # Not currently on any branch. # Changes to be committed: # (use \"git reset HEAD^1 &lt;file&gt;...\" to unstage) # # modified: a #  As before, Git is showing the commit message for you to edit. You can change the text (\"i cant' typ goods\"), save the file, and close the editor. Git will finish the rebase and return you to the terminal.  Pushing rebased code to GitHub Since you've altered Git history, the usual git push origin will not work. You'll need to modify the command by \"force-pushing\" your latest changes:  git push origin master --force   Force pushing has serious implications, especially if your repository is being accessed by multiple people. At the least, your commits in pull requests might be out of order.

We'll go in-depth on these commands below.  Clone To grab a complete copy of another user's repository, use git clone like this:  git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git # Clones a repository to your computer  You can choose from several different URLs when cloning a repository. While logged in to GitHub, these URLs are available below the repository details:  When you run git clone, the following actions occur:  A new folder called repo is made It is initialized as a Git repository A remote named origin is created, pointing to the URL you cloned from All of the repository's files and commits are downloaded there The default branch (usually called master) is checked out  For every branch foo in the remote repository, a corresponding remote-tracking branch refs/remotes/origin/foo is created in your local repository. You can usually abbreviate such remote-tracking branch names to origin/foo.  Fetch Use git fetch to retrieve new work done by other people. Fetching from a repository grabs all the new remote-tracking branches and tags without merging those changes into your own branches. If you already have a local repository with a remote URL set up for the desired project, you can grab all the new information by using git fetch *remotename* in the terminal:  git fetch remotename # Fetches updates made to a remote repository  Otherwise, you can always add a new remote and then fetch.  Merge Merging combines your local changes with changes made by others. Typically, you'd merge a remote-tracking branch (i.e., a branch fetched from a remote repository) with your local branch:  git merge remotename/branchname # Merges updates made online with your local work   Pull git pull is a convenient shortcut for completing both git fetch and git mergein the same command:  git pull remotename branchname # Grabs online updates and merges them with your local work  Because pull performs a merge on the retrieved changes, you should ensure that your local work is committed before running the pull command. If you run into a merge conflict you cannot resolve, or if you decide to quit the merge, you can use git merge --abort to take the branch back to where it was in before you pulled.

That means that two of your commits modified the same line in the same file, and Git doesn't know which change to apply.  After you reorder and manipulate commits using git rebase, should a merge conflict occur, Git will tell you so with the following message printed to the terminal:  error: could not apply fa39187... something to add to patch A When you have resolved this problem, run \"git rebase --continue\". If you prefer to skip this patch, run \"git rebase --skip\" instead. To check out the original branch and stop rebasing, run \"git rebase --abort\". Could not apply fa39187f3c3dfd2ab5faa38ac01cf3de7ce2e841... Change fake file  Here, Git is telling you which commit is causing the conflict (fa39187). You're given three choices:  You can run git rebase --abort to completely undo the rebase. Git will return you to your branch's state as it was before git rebase was called. You can run git rebase --skip to completely skip the commit. That means that none of the changes introduced by the problematic commit will be included. It is very rare that you would choose this option. You can fix the conflict.  To fix the conflict, you can follow the standard procedures for resolving merge conflicts from the command line. When you're finished, you'll need to call git rebase --continue in order for Git to continue processing the rest of the rebase.",

      "url": "/articles/fork-a-repo",
      "body": " A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.  Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.  Propose changes to someone else's project A great example of using forks to propose changes is for bug fixes. Rather than logging an issue for a bug you've found, you can:  Fork the repository. Make the fix. Submit a pull request to the project owner.  If the project owner likes your work, they might pull your fix into the original repository!  Use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea. At the heart of open source is the idea that by sharing code, we can make better, more reliable software. When creating your public repository from a fork of someone's project, make sure to include a license file that determines how you want your project to be shared with others. For more information on open source, specifically how to create and grow an open source project, we've created Open Source Guides that will help you foster a healthy open source community by recommending best practices for creating and maintaining repositories for your open source project.  Fork an example repository Forking a repository is a simple two-step process. We've created a repository for you to practice with!  On GitHub, navigate to the octocat/Spoon-Knife repository. In the top-right corner of the page, click Fork.    That's it! Now, you have a fork of the original octocat/Spoon-Knife repository.  Keep your fork synced You might fork a project in order to propose changes to the upstream, or original, repository. In this case, it's good practice to regularly sync your fork with the upstream repository. To do this, you'll need to use Git on the command line. You can practice setting the upstream repository using the same octocat/Spoon-Knife repository you just forked!  Step 1: Set Up Git If you haven't yet, you should first set up Git. Don't forget to set up authentication to GitHub from Git as well.  Step 2: Create a local clone of your fork Right now, you have a fork of the Spoon-Knife repository, but you don't have the files in that repository on your computer. Let's create a clone of your fork locally on your computer.  On GitHub, navigate to your fork of the Spoon-Knife repository. Under the repository name, click Clone or download.  In the Clone with HTTPs section, click  to copy the clone URL for the repository.  Open TerminalTerminalGit Bash.  Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 2. It will look like this, with your GitHub username instead of YOUR-USERNAME:  git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Spoon-Knife    Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.  git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Spoon-Knife Cloning into `Spoon-Knife`... remote: Counting objects: 10, done. remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done. remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1) Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.    Now, you have a local copy of your fork of the Spoon-Knife repository!  Step 3: Configure Git to sync your fork with the original Spoon-Knife repository When you fork a project in order to propose changes to the original repository, you can configure Git to pull changes from the original, or upstream, repository into the local clone of your fork.  On GitHub, navigate to the octocat/Spoon-Knife repository. Under the repository name, click Clone or download.  In the Clone with HTTPs section, click  to copy the clone URL for the repository.  Open TerminalTerminalGit Bash.  Change directories to the location of the fork you cloned in Step 2: Create a local clone of your fork.  To go to your home directory, type just cd with no other text. To list the files and folders in your current directory, type ls. To go into one of your listed directories, type cd your_listed_directory. To go up one directory, type cd ...    Type git remote -v and press Enter. You'll see the current configured remote repository for your fork.  git remote -v origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (fetch) origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (push)    Type git remote add upstream, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 2 and press Enter. It will look like this:  git remote add upstream https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife.git    To verify the new upstream repository you've specified for your fork, type git remote -v again. You should see the URL for your fork as origin, and the URL for the original repository as upstream.  git remote -v origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (fetch) origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (push) upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git (fetch) upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git (push)    Now, you can keep your fork synced with the upstream repository with a few Git commands. For more information, see \"Syncing a fork.\"  Next Steps The sky's the limit with the changes you can make to a fork, including:   Creating branches: Branches allow you to build new features or test out ideas without putting your main project at risk.  Opening pull requests: If you are hoping to contribute back to the original repository, you can send a request to the original author to pull your fork into their repository by submitting a pull request.   Find another repository to fork Every public repository can be forked, so find another project you're interested in and get forking! Explore GitHub is a great place to find projects that pique your interest. Visit that page often to see what's new and cool.   Celebrate You have now forked a repository, practiced cloning your fork, and configured an upstream repository.

      "body": "Effective date: January 26, 2017 Thanks for entrusting GitHub with your source code, your projects, and your personal information. Holding onto your private information is a serious responsibility, and we want you to know how we're handling it.  The short version We collect your information only with your consent; we only collect the minimum amount of personal information that is necessary to fulfill the purpose of your interaction with us; we don't sell it to third parties; and we only use it as this Privacy Statement describes. If you're visiting us from the EU: we comply with the Privacy Shield framework. Of course, the short version doesn't tell you everything, so please read on for more details!  What information GitHub collects and why  Information from website browsers If you're just browsing the website, we collect the same basic information that most websites collect. We use common internet technologies, such as cookies and web server logs. This is stuff we collect from everybody, whether they have an account or not. The information we collect about all visitors to our website includes the visitor’s browser type, language preference, referring site, additional websites requested, and the date and time of each visitor request. We also collect potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.  Why do we collect this? We collect this information to better understand how our website visitors use GitHub, and to monitor and protect the security of the website.  Information from users with accounts If you create an account, we require some basic information at the time of account creation. You will create your own user name and password, and we will ask you for a valid email account. You also have the option to give us more information if you want to, and this may include \"User Personal Information.\" \"User Personal Information\" is any information about one of our users which could, alone or together with other information, personally identify him or her. Information such as a user name and password, an email address, a real name, and a photograph are examples of “User Personal Information.” User Personal Information does not include aggregated, non-personally identifying information. We may use aggregated, non-personally identifying information to operate, improve, and optimize our website and service.  Why do we collect this?  We need your User Personal Information to create your account, and to provide the services you request. We use your User Personal Information, specifically your user name, to identify you on GitHub. We use it to fill out your profile and share that profile with other users if you ask us to. We will use your email address to communicate with you, if you've said that's okay, and only for the reasons you’ve said that’s okay. Please see our section on email communication for more information. We limit our use of your User Personal Information to the purposes listed in this Privacy Statement. If we need to use your User Personal Information for other purposes, we will ask your permission first. You can always see what information we have, how we're using it, and what permissions you have given us in your user profile.   What information GitHub does not collect We do not intentionally collect sensitive personal information, such as social security numbers, genetic data, health information, or religious information. Although GitHub does not request or intentionally collect any sensitive personal information, we realize that you might store this kind of information in your account, such as in a repository. If you store any sensitive personal information on our servers, you are consenting to our storage of that information on our servers, which are in the United States. We do not intentionally collect information that is stored in your repositories or other free-form content inputs. Information in your repositories belongs to you, and you are responsible for it, as well as for making sure that your content complies with our Terms of Service. GitHub employees do not access private repositories unless required to for security or maintenance, or for support reasons, with the consent of the repository owner. If your repository is public, anyone (including us) may view its contents. If you have included private or sensitive information in your public repository, such as email addresses, that information may be indexed by search engines or used by third parties. In addition, while we do not generally search for content in your repositories, we may scan our servers for certain tokens or security signatures. If you're a child under the age of 13, you may not have an account on GitHub. GitHub does not knowingly collect information from or direct any of our content specifically to children under 13. If we learn or have reason to suspect that you are a user who is under the age of 13, we will unfortunately have to close your account. We don't want to discourage you from learning to code, but those are the rules. Please see our Terms of Service for information about account termination.  How we share the information we collect We do not share, sell, rent, or trade User Personal Information with third parties for their commercial purposes. We do not disclose User Personal Information outside GitHub, except in the situations listed in this section or in the section below on Compelled Disclosure. We do share certain aggregated, non-personally identifying information with others about how our users, collectively, use GitHub, or how our users respond to our other offerings, such as our conferences or events. For example, we may compile statistics on the usage of open source licenses across GitHub. However, we do not sell this information to advertisers or marketers. We do not host advertising on GitHub. We may occasionally embed content from third party sites, such as YouTube, and that content may include ads. While we try to minimize the amount of ads our embedded content contains, we can't always control what third parties show. We may share User Personal Information with your permission, so we can perform services you have requested. We may share User Personal Information with a limited number of third-party vendors who process it on our behalf to provide or improve our service, and who have agreed to privacy restrictions similar to our own Privacy Statement. Our vendors perform services such as payment processing, customer support ticketing, network data transmission, and other similar services. When we transfer your data to our vendors under Privacy Shield, we remain responsible for it. We may share User Personal Information if we are involved in a merger, sale, or acquisition. If any such change of ownership happens, we will ensure that it is under terms that preserve the confidentiality of User Personal Information, and we will notify you on our website or by email before any transfer of your User Personal Information. The organization receiving any User Personal Information will have to honor any promises we have made in our Privacy Statement or in our Terms of Service.  Public Information on GitHub Much of GitHub is public-facing. If your content is public-facing, third parties may access and use it in compliance with our Terms of Service. We do not sell that content; it is yours. However, we do allow third parties, such as research organizations or archives, to compile public-facing GitHub information. Your Personal Information, associated with your content, may be gathered by third parties in these compilations of GitHub data. If you do not want your Personal Information to appear in third parties’ compilations of GitHub data, please do not make your Personal Information publicly available and be sure to configure your email address to be private in your user profile. If you would like to compile GitHub data, you may only use any public-facing Personal Information you gather for the purpose for which our user has authorized it. For example, where a GitHub user has made an email address public-facing for the purpose of identification and attribution, do not use that email address for commercial advertising. We expect you to reasonably secure any Personal Information you have gathered from GitHub, and to respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and \"do not contact\" requests from GitHub or GitHub users. Similarly, projects on GitHub may include publicly available Personal Information collected as part of the collaborative process. In the event that a GitHub project contains publicly available Personal Information that does not belong to GitHub users, we will only use that Personal Information for the limited purpose for which it was collected, and we will secure that Personal Information as we would secure any User Personal Information. If you have a complaint about any Personal Information on GitHub, please see our section on resolving complaints.  Our use of cookies and tracking  Cookies GitHub uses cookies to make interactions with our service easy and meaningful. We use cookies (and similar technologies, like HTML5 localStorage) to keep you logged in, remember your preferences, and provide information for future development of GitHub. A cookie is a small piece of text that our web server stores on your computer or mobile device, which your browser sends to us when you return to our site. Cookies do not necessarily identify you if you are merely visiting GitHub; however, a cookie may store a unique identifier for each logged in user. The cookies GitHub sets are essential for the operation of the website, or are used for performance or functionality. By using our website, you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your computer or device. If you disable your browser or device’s ability to accept cookies, you will not be able to log in or use GitHub’s services.  Google Analytics We use Google Analytics as a third party tracking service, but we don’t use it to track you individually or collect your User Personal Information. We use Google Analytics to collect information about how our website performs and how our users, in general, navigate through and use GitHub. This helps us evaluate our users' use of GitHub; compile statistical reports on activity; and improve our content and website performance. Google Analytics gathers certain simple, non-personally identifying information over time, such as your IP address, browser type, internet service provider, referring and exit pages, time stamp, and similar data about your use of GitHub. We do not link this information to any of your personal information such as your user name. GitHub will not, nor will we allow any third party to, use the Google Analytics tool to track our users individually; collect any User Personal Information other than IP address; or correlate your IP address with your identity. Google provides further information about its own privacy practices and offers a browser add-on to opt out of Google Analytics tracking. Certain pages on our site may set other third party cookies. For example, we may embed content, such as videos, from another site that sets a cookie. While we try to minimize these third party cookies, we can’t always control what cookies this third party content sets.  Tracking \"Do Not Track\" is a privacy preference you can set in your browser if you do not want online services to collect and share certain kinds of information about your online activity from third party tracking services. We do not track your online browsing activity on other online services over time and we do not permit third-party services to track your activity on our site beyond our basic Google Analytics tracking, which you may opt out of here. Because we do not share this kind of data with third party services or permit this kind of third party data collection on GitHub for any of our users, and we do not track our users on third-party websites ourselves, we do not need to respond differently to an individual browser's Do Not Track setting. If you are interested in turning on your browser’s privacy and Do Not Track settings, the Do Not Track website has browser-specific instructions. Please see our section on email communication to learn about our use of pixel tags in marketing emails.  How GitHub secures your information GitHub takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect User Personal Information from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction; maintain data accuracy; and help ensure the appropriate use of User Personal Information. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. For more information, see our security disclosures.  GitHub's global privacy practices Information that we collect will be stored and processed in the United States in accordance with this Privacy Statement. However, we understand that we have users from different countries and regions with different privacy expectations, and we try to meet those needs. We provide the same standard of privacy protection to all our users around the world, regardless of their country of origin or location, and we are proud of the levels of notice, choice, accountability, security, data integrity, access, and recourse we provide. We have appointed a Privacy Counsel and we work hard to comply with the applicable data privacy laws wherever we do business. Additionally, we require that if our vendors or affiliates have access to User Personal Information, they must comply with our privacy policies and with applicable data privacy laws, including signing data transfer agreements such as Standard Contractual Clause agreements. In particular:   GitHub provides clear methods of unambiguous, informed consent at the time of data collection, when we do collect your personal data.  We collect only the minimum amount of personal data necessary, unless you choose to provide more. We encourage you to only give us the amount of data you are comfortable sharing.  We offer you simple methods of accessing, correcting, or deleting the data we have collected.  We provide our users notice, choice, accountability, security, and access, and we limit the purpose for processing. We also provide our users a method of recourse and enforcement. These are the Privacy Shield Principles, but they are also just good practices.  GitHub adheres to the Privacy Shield Framework. You may view our entry in the Privacy Shield List. In addition to providing our users methods of unambiguous, informed consent and control over their data, we participate in and comply with the Privacy Shield framework, and we are committed to subject any Personal Information we receive from the EU and EEA to the Privacy Shield Principles. In addition, we continue to participate in the Safe Harbor Framework for Swiss data transfers to the US. Please read more about GitHub's Privacy Shield and Safe Harbor commitments.   Resolving Complaints If you have concerns about the way GitHub is handling your User Personal Information, please let us know immediately. We want to help. You may contact us by filling out the Privacy contact form. You may also email us directly at privacy@github.com with the subject line \"Privacy Shield Concerns.\" We will respond within 45 days at the latest.  Dispute Resolution Process In the unlikely event that a dispute arises between you and GitHub regarding our handling of your User Personal Information, we will do our best to resolve it. If we cannot, we have selected JAMS, an independent dispute resolution provider, to handle unresolved Privacy Shield complaints. If we are unable to resolve your concerns after a good faith effort to address them, you may contact JAMS and submit a Privacy Shield claim. JAMS is a US-based private alternate dispute resolution provider, and we have contracted with JAMS to provide an independent recourse mechanism for any of our users for privacy concerns at no cost to you. You do not need to appear in court; you may conduct this dispute resolution process via telephone or video conference. If you are not based in the EU or EEA, but you would still like to use the JAMS arbitration process to resolve your dispute, please let us know and we will provide access to you.  Independent Arbitration Under certain limited circumstances, European Union individuals may invoke binding Privacy Shield arbitration as a last resort if all other forms of dispute resolution have been unsuccessful. To learn more about this method of resolution and its availability to you, please read more about Privacy Shield.  We are subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission.  How we respond to compelled disclosure GitHub may disclose personally-identifying information or other information we collect about you to law enforcement in response to a valid subpoena, court order, warrant, or similar government order, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect our property or rights, or those of third parties or the public at large. In complying with court orders and similar legal processes, GitHub strives for transparency. When permitted, we will make a reasonable effort to notify users of any disclosure of their information, unless we are prohibited by law or court order from doing so, or in rare, exigent circumstances. For more information, see our Guidelines for Legal Requests of User Data.  How you can access and control the information we collect If you're already a GitHub user, you may access, update, alter, or delete your basic user profile information by editing your user profile or contacting GitHub Support.  Data Retention and Deletion GitHub will retain User Personal Information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We may retain certain User Personal Information indefinitely, unless you delete it or request its deletion. For example, we don’t automatically delete inactive user accounts, so unless you choose to delete your account, we will retain your account information indefinitely. If you would like to cancel your account or delete your User Personal Information, you may do so in your user profile. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile (within reason) within 30 days.  How we communicate with you We will use your email address to communicate with you, if you've said that's okay, and only for the reasons you’ve said that’s okay. You have a lot of control over how your email address is used and shared on and through GitHub. You may manage your communication preferences in your user profile. If you would like your email to remain private, even when you’re commenting on public repositories, you can create a private email address in your user profile. You can also update your local Git configuration to use your private email address. This will not change how we contact you, but it will affect how others see you. Depending on your email settings, GitHub may occasionally send notification emails about changes in a repository you’re watching, new features, requests for feedback, important policy changes, or offer customer support. We also send marketing emails, but only with your consent. There's an unsubscribe link located at the bottom of each of the emails we send you. Our emails might contain a pixel tag, which is a small, clear image that can tell us whether or not you have opened an email and what your IP address is. We use this pixel tag to make our email more effective for you and to make sure we’re not sending you unwanted email. If you prefer not to receive pixel tags, please opt out of marketing emails.  Changes to our Privacy Statement Although most changes are likely to be minor, GitHub may change our Privacy Statement from time to time. We will provide notification to Users of material changes to this Privacy Statement through our Website at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our home page or sending email to the email address specified in your GitHub primary account. For changes to this Privacy Statement that do not affect your rights, we encourage visitors to check this page frequently.

      "body": " If a commit message contains unclear, incorrect, or sensitive information, you can amend it locally and push a new commit with a new message to GitHub.   Rewriting the most recent commit message You can change the most recent commit message using the git commit --amend command.  In Git, the text of the commit message is part of the commit. Changing the commit message will change the commit ID--i.e., the SHA1 checksum that names the commit. Effectively, you are creating a new commit that replaces the old one.   Commit has not been pushed online If the commit only exists in your local repository and has not been pushed to GitHub, you can amend the commit message with the git commit --amend command.  On the command line, navigate to the repository that contains the commit you want to amend. Type git commit --amend and press Enter. In your text editor, edit the commit message and save the commit.  The new commit and message will appear on GitHub the next time you push.  You can change the default text editor for Git by changing the core.editor setting. For more information, see \"Basic Client Configuration\" in the Git manual.   Amending older or multiple commit messages If you have already pushed the commit to GitHub, you will have to force push a commit with an amended message.  We strongly discourage force pushing, since this changes the history of your repository. If you force push, people who have already cloned your repository will have to manually fix their local history. For more information, see \"Recovering from upstream rebase\" in the Git manual.  Amending the message of the most recently pushed commit  Follow the steps above to amend the commit message. Use the push --force command to force push over the old commit.  git push --force example-branch    Amending the message of older or multiple commit messages If you need to amend the message for multiple commits or an older commit, you can use interactive rebase, then force push to change the commit history.  On the command line, navigate to the repository that contains the commit you want to amend. Use the git rebase -i HEAD~n command to display a list of the last n commits in your default text editor.  git rebase -i HEAD~3 # Displays a list of the last 3 commits on the current branch    The list will look similar to the following:  pick e499d89 Delete CNAME pick 0c39034 Better README pick f7fde4a Change the commit message but push the same commit. # Rebase 9fdb3bd..f7fde4a onto 9fdb3bd # # Commands: # p, pick = use commit # r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message # e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending # s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit # f, fixup = like \"squash\", but discard this commit's log message # x, exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shell # # These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom. # # If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST. # # However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted. # # Note that empty commits are commented out    Replace pick with reword before each commit message you want to change.  pick e499d89 Delete CNAME reword 0c39034 Better README reword f7fde4a Change the commit message but push the same commit.   Save and close the commit list file. In each resulting commit file, type the new commit message, save the file, and close it. Force-push the amended commits.  git push --force    For more information on interactive rebase, see \"Interactive mode\" in the Git manual.  As before, amending the commit message will result in a new commit with a new ID. However, in this case, every commit that follows the amended commit will also get a new ID because each commit also contains the id of its parent.   If you have included sensitive information in a commit message, force pushing a commit with an amended commit may not remove the original commit from GitHub. The old commit will not be a part of a subsequent clone; however, it may still be cached on GitHub and accessible via the commit ID. You must contact GitHub Support with the old commit ID to have it purged from the remote repository.   Further reading  \"Signing commits using GPG\" ",

Using a company or business name, logo, or other trademark-protected materials in a manner that may mislead or confuse others with regard to its brand or business affiliation may be considered a trademark policy violation.  What is not a GitHub Trademark Policy Violation? Using another's trademark in a way that has nothing to do with the product or service for which the trademark was granted is not a trademark policy violation. GitHub user names are available on a first come, first served basis and may not be reserved. A GitHub account with a user name that happens to be the same as a registered trademark is not, by itself, necessarily a violation of our trademark policy.  How Does GitHub Respond To Reported Trademark Policy Violations? When we receive reports of trademark policy violations from holders of federal or international trademark registrations, we review the account and may take the following actions:  When there is a clear intent to mislead others through the unauthorized use of a trademark, GitHub will suspend the account and notify the account holder. When we determine that an account appears to be confusing users, but is not purposefully passing itself off as the trademarked good or service, we give the account holder an opportunity to clear up any potential confusion. We may also release a username for the trademark holder's active use.   How Do I Report a Trademark Policy Violation? Holders of registered trademarks can report possible trademark policy violations to GitHub via email to support@github.com. Please submit trademark-related requests from your company email address and include all the information requested below to help expedite our response.

When pushing commits to a pull request, don't force push. Force pushing can corrupt your pull request.

You can add a summary of the proposed changes, review the changes made by commits, add labels, milestones, and assignees, and @mention individual contributors or teams. For more information, see \"Creating a pull request.\"  Once you've created a pull request, you can push commits from your topic branch to add them to your existing pull request. These commits will appear in chronological order within your pull request and the changes will be visible in the \"Files changed\" tab. Other contributors can review your proposed changes, add review comments, contribute to the pull request discussion, and even add commits to the pull request. After you're happy with the proposed changes, you can merge the pull request. If you're working in a shared repository model, the proposed changes will be merged from the head branch to the base branch that was specified in the pull request.

Create a local .gitignore If you create a file in your repository named .gitignore, Git uses it to determine which files and directories to ignore, before you make a commit. A .gitignore file should be committed into your repository, in order to share the ignore rules with any other users that clone the repository. GitHub maintains an official list of recommended .gitignore files for many popular operating systems, environments, and languages in the github/gitignore public repository.  In Terminal, navigate to the location of your Git repository. Enter touch .gitignore to create a .gitignore file.  The Octocat has a Gist containing some good rules to add to this file. If you already have a file checked in, and you want to ignore it, Git will not ignore the file if you add a rule later. In those cases, you must untrack the file first, by running the following command in your terminal:  git rm --cached FILENAME   Create a global .gitignore You can also create a global .gitignore file, which is a list of rules for ignoring files in every Git repository on your computer. For example, you might create the file at ~/.gitignore_global and add some rules to it.  Open Terminal. Run the following command in your terminal:  git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global    The Octocat has a Gist containing some good rules to add to this file.  Explicit repository excludes If you don't want to create a .gitignore file to share with others, you can create rules that are not committed with the repository. You can use this technique for locally-generated files that you don't expect other users to generate, such as files created by your editor. Use your favorite text editor to open the file called .git/info/exclude within the root of your Git repository. Any rule you add here will not be checked in, and will only ignore files for your local repository.  In Terminal, navigate to the location of your Git repository. Using your favorite text editor, open the file .git/info/exclude.   Further Reading  .gitignore manual Pro Git Example .gitignore files ",

Tips:  There's a list of search syntaxes you can add to any search qualifier to further improve your results. Use quotations around your multi-word search terms. For example, if you want to search for issues with the label \"In progress,\" you'd search for label:\"in progress\". Search is not case sensitive.    Search within commit messages You can find commits that contain particular words in the message.  fix typo Matches commits containing the words \"fix\" and \"typo\".   Search by author or committer You can find commits by a particular user with the author or committer qualifiers.  author:defunkt Matches commits authored by @defunkt. committer:defunkt Matches commits committed by @defunkt.  The author-name and committer-name qualifiers match commits by the name of the author or committer.  author-name:wanstrath Matches commits with \"wanstrath\" in the author name. committer-name:wanstrath Matches commits with \"wanstrath\" in the committer name.  The author-email and committer-email qualifiers match commits by the author's or committer's full email address.  author-email:chris@github.com Matches commits authored by chris@github.com. committer-email:chris@github.com Matches commits committed by chris@github.com.   Search within a user or organization's repositories To find commits from all repositories owned by a certain user or organization, use the user qualifier. To find commits from a specific repository, use the repo qualifier. For example:  user:defunkt Matches commits from repositories owned by @defunkt. repo:defunkt/gibberish Matches commits from @defunkt's \"gibberish\" repository.   Search by authored or committed date Use the author-date and committer-date qualifiers to match commits authored or committed within the specified date range.  author-date:&lt;2016-01-01 Matches commits authored before 2016-01-01. committer-date:&lt;2016-01-01 Matches commits committed before 2016-01-01.   Filter merge commits The merge qualifier filters merge commits.  merge:true Matches merge commits. merge:false Matches non-merge commits.   Search by hash The hash qualifier matches commits with the specified SHA-1 hash.  hash:124a9a0ee1d8f1e15e833aff432fbb3b02632105 Matches commits with the hash 124a9a0ee1d8f1e15e833aff432fbb3b02632105.   Search by parent The parent qualifier matches commits whose parent has the specified SHA-1 hash.  parent:124a9a0ee1d8f1e15e833aff432fbb3b02632105 Matches children of 124a9a0ee1d8f1e15e833aff432fbb3b02632105.

      "body": " You can configure GitHub Pages to publish your site's source files from master, gh-pages, or a /docs folder on your master branch for Project Pages and other Pages sites that meet certain criteria.  If your site is a User or Organization Page that has a repository named &lt;username&gt;.github.io or &lt;orgname&gt;.github.io, you cannot publish your site's source files from different locations. User and Organization Pages that have this type of repository name are only published from the master branch. For more information about the different types of GitHub Pages sites, see \"User, Organization, and Project Pages.\"  Default source settings for repositories without the username naming scheme The default settings for publishing your site's source files depend on your site type and the branches you have in your site repository. If your site repository doesn't have a master or gh-pages branch, your GitHub Pages publishing source is set to None and your site is not published.  After you've created either a master or gh-pages branch, you can set one as your publishing source so that your site will be published. If you fork or upload your site repository with only a master or gh-pages branch, your site's source setting will automatically be enabled for that branch.  Enabling GitHub Pages to publish your site from master or gh-pages  To select master or gh-pages as your publishing source, you must have the branch present in your repository. If you don't have a master or gh-pages branch, you can create them and then return to source settings to change your publishing source.  On GitHub, navigate to your GitHub Pages site's repository. Under your repository name, click  Settings.  Use the Select source drop-down menu to select master or gh-pages as your GitHub Pages publishing source.  Click Save.     Publishing your GitHub Pages site from a /docs folder on your master branch To publish your site's source files from a /docs folder on your master branch, you must have a master branch and your repository must:  have a /docs folder in the root of the repository not follow the repository naming scheme &lt;username&gt;.github.io or &lt;orgname&gt;.github.io   GitHub Pages will read everything to publish your site, including the CNAME file, from the /docs folder. For example, when you edit your custom domain through the GitHub Pages settings, the custom domain will write to /docs/CNAME.  Tip: If you remove the /docs folder from the master branch after it's enabled, your site won't build and you'll get a page build error message for a missing /docs folder.   On GitHub, navigate to your GitHub Pages site's repository. Create a folder in the root of your repository on the master branch called /docs. Under your repository name, click  Settings.

      "url": "/articles/dealing-with-line-endings",
      "body": " If you're using Git to collaborate with others on GitHub, ensure that Git is properly configured to handle line endings.  Every time you press return on your keyboard you're actually inserting an invisible character called a line ending. Historically, different operating systems have handled line endings differently. When you view changes in a file, Git handles line endings in its own way. Since you're collaborating on projects with Git and GitHub, Git might produce unexpected results if, for example, you're working on a Windows machine, and your collaborator has made a change in OS X.  Global settings for line endings The git config core.autocrlf command is used to change how Git handles line endings. It takes a single argument.  On OS X, you simply pass input to the configuration. For example:  git config --global core.autocrlf input # Configure Git on OS X to properly handle line endings    On Windows, you simply pass true to the configuration. For example:  git config --global core.autocrlf true # Configure Git on Windows to properly handle line endings    On Linux, you simply pass input to the configuration. For example:  git config --global core.autocrlf input # Configure Git on Linux to properly handle line endings    On OS X and Linux, you usually want to pass input for this setting. On Windows, you usually want to use true. For example:  git config --global core.autocrlf input # Configure Git on OS X or Linux to properly handle line endings git config --global core.autocrlf true # Configure Git on Windows to properly handle line endings    Per-repository settings Optionally, you can configure the way Git manages line endings on a per-repository basis by configuring a special .gitattributes file. This file is committed into the repository and overrides an individual's core.autocrlf setting, ensuring consistent behavior for all users, regardless of their Git settings. The advantage of a .gitattributes file is that your line configurations are associated with your repository. You don't need to worry about whether or not collaborators have the same line ending settings that you do. The .gitattributes file must be created in the root of the repository and committed like any other file. Here's [an example of the file][git-atts-sample] in the GitHub Developer's Guide. A .gitattributes file looks like a table with two columns:  On the left is the file name for Git to match. On the right is the line ending configuration that Git should use for those files.   Example Here's an example .gitattributes file. You can use it as a template for your repositories: # Set the default behavior, in case people don't have core.autocrlf set. * text=auto # Explicitly declare text files you want to always be normalized and converted # to native line endings on checkout. *.c text *.h text # Declare files that will always have CRLF line endings on checkout. *.sln text eol=crlf # Denote all files that are truly binary and should not be modified. *.png binary *.jpg binary  You'll notice that files are matched--*.c, *.sln, *.png--, separated by a space, then given a setting--text, text eol=crlf, binary. We'll go over some possible settings below.  text=auto Git will handle the files in whatever way it thinks is best. This is a good default option.  text eol=crlf Git will always convert line endings to CRLF on checkout. You should use this for files that must keep CRLF endings, even on OSX or Linux. For example, here is a Windows project that enforces CRLF line endings.  text eol=lf Git will always convert line endings to LF on checkout. You should use this for files that must keep LF endings, even on Windows. For example, here is a project that enforces LF line endings.  binary Git will understand that the files specified are not text, and it should not try to change them. The binary setting is also an alias for -text -diff.  Refreshing a repository after changing line endings After you've set the core.autocrlf option and committed a .gitattributes file, you may find that Git wants to commit files that you have not modified. At this point, Git is eager to change the line endings of every file for you. The best way to automatically configure your repository's line endings is to first backup your files with Git, delete every file in your repository (except the .git directory), and then restore the files all at once.   Save your current files in Git, so that none of your work is lost.  git add . -u git commit -m \"Saving files before refreshing line endings\"    Remove the index and force Git to rescan the working directory.  rm .git/index    Rewrite the Git index to pick up all the new line endings.  git reset    Show the rewritten, normalized files.  git status    Add all your changed files back, and prepare them for a commit. This is your chance to inspect which files, if any, were unchanged.  git add -u # It is perfectly safe to see a lot of messages here that read # \"warning: CRLF will be replaced by LF in file.\"    Rewrite the .gitattributes file.  git add .gitattributes    Commit the changes to your repository.  git commit -m \"Normalize all the line endings\"     Further reading  \"Customizing Git - Git Attributes\" from the Pro Git book \"git-config(1) Manual Page\" \"Getting Started - First-Time Git Setup\" from the Pro Git book \"Mind the End of Your Line\" - The full story of line endings in Git by Tim Clem   ",

No endorsement - Company agrees that Your seals, trademarks, logos, service marks, trade names, and the fact that You have a presence on the Company site and use its services, shall not be used by Company in such a manner as to state or imply that Company's products or services are endorsed, sponsored or recommended by You or by any other element of the Federal Government, or are considered by these entities to be superior to any other products or services. Except for pages whose design and content is under the control of the Agency, or for links to or promotion of such pages, Company agrees not to display any Agency or government seals or logos on the Company's homepage or elsewhere on the Company Site, unless permission to do so has been granted by the Agency or by other relevant federal government authority. Company may list the Agency's name in a publicly available customer list so long as the name is not displayed in a more prominent fashion than that of any other third-party name. Provision of data - In case of termination of service, within 30 days of such termination, upon request, Company will provide you with all user-generated content that is publicly visible through the Sites You created at Company. Data will be provided in a commonly used file or database format as Company deems appropriate. Company will not provide data if doing so would violate its privacy policy, available at https://help.github.com/privacy/.   C. Unpaid and paid plans  No cost agreement - Nothing in this Amendment or ToS obligates You to expend appropriations or incur financial obligations. The Parties acknowledge and agree that none of the obligations arising from this Amendment or ToS are contingent upon the payment of fees by one party to the other. At the Company’s discretion, GitHub may offer a free account under a free usage plan, such as a Free for Open Source Plan, and in that case this Amendment will apply to the Agency’s usage under the free account/plan. This Amendment also applies when the Agency uses one of GitHub’s paid usage plans. Agency responsibilities under paid usage plans - You acknowledge that while Company will provide You with service under a free plan, Company reserves the right to begin charging for that service at some point in the future. Company will provide You with at least 30 days advance notice of a change involving the charging of fees for a free service. You also understand that Company offers paid plans for a fee. The Parties understand that fee-based services are categorically different than free products, and are subject to federal procurement rules and processes. Before the Agency decides to enter into a business or enterprise subscription, or any other fee-based service that this Company or alternative providers may offer now or in the future, You agree: to determine the Agency has a need for those additional services for a fee; to consider the subscription's value in comparison with comparable services available elsewhere; to determine that Agency funds are available for payment; to properly use the Government Purchase Card if that Card is used as the payment method; to review any then-applicable ToS for conformance to federal procurement law; and in all other respects to follow applicable federal acquisition laws, regulations and agency guidelines (including those related to payments) when initiating that separate action. No business relationship created - The Parties are independent entities and nothing in this Amendment or ToS creates an agency, partnership, joint venture, or employer/employee relationship.   D. Federal Regulations  Security - Company will, in good faith, exercise due diligence using generally accepted commercial business practices for IT security, to ensure that systems are operated and maintained in a secure manner, and that management, operational and technical controls will be employed to ensure security of systems and data. Recognizing the changing nature of the Web, Company will continuously work with users to ensure that its products and services are operated and maintained in a secure manner. Company agrees to discuss implementing additional security controls as deemed necessary by the Agency to conform to the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), 44 U.S.C. 3541 et seq. Federal Records - Agency acknowledges that use of Company's site and services may require management of Federal records. Agency and user-generated content may meet the definition of Federal records as determined by the agency. If the Company holds Federal records, the Agency and the Company must manage Federal records in accordance with all applicable records management laws and regulations, including but not limited to the Federal Records Act (44 U.S.C. chs. 21, 29, 31, 33), and regulations of the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) at 36 CFR Chapter XII Subchapter B). Managing the records includes, but is not limited to, secure storage, retrievability, and proper disposition of all Federal records including transfer of permanently valuable records to NARA in a format and manner acceptable to NARA at the time of transfer. The Agency is responsible for ensuring that the Company is compliant with applicable records management laws and regulations through the life and termination of the Agreement.   E. General Conditions  Indemnification - Any provisions in the ToS related to indemnification, damages, attorney’s fees, and settlement are hereby waived. Liability of the Agency for any breach of the ToS or this Agreement, or any claim, demand, suit or proceeding arising from the ToS or this Agreement, shall be determined under the Federal Tort Claims Act, or other governing authority. Liability of Company for any breach of the ToS or this Agreement, or any claim, demand, suit or proceeding arising from the ToS or this Agreement, shall be determined by applicable federal or state law. Limitation of liability - The Parties agree that nothing in the Limitation of Liability clause or elsewhere in the ToS in any way grants Company a waiver from, release of, or limitation of liability pertaining to, any past, current or future violation of federal law. Governing law and Forum - The dispute resolution provision in the ToS is hereby deleted. The ToS and this Amendment shall be governed, interpreted and enforced in accordance with applicable federal laws of the United States of America and exclusive jurisdiction shall be in the appropriate U.S. federal courts. To the extent permitted by federal law, the laws of the State of California will apply in the absence of federal law. Assignment - Neither party may assign its obligations under this Amendment or ToS to any third-party without prior written consent of the other; however, GitHub may, without the Agency's consent, assign its obligations to an Agency using the service under a free usage plan under this Amendment or ToS to an affiliate or to a successor or acquirer, as the case may be, in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization or consolidation, or the sale of all or substantially all of GitHub's assets.   F. Changes to this agreement  Changes to standard ToS - Language in the ToS reserving to Company the right to make material changes to the ToS is hereby amended to grant You at least three days advance notice of any material change to the ToS. Company shall send this notice to the email address You designate as your account's primary billing email address. You are responsible for updating this email address in the event that your notification preferences change. Precedence; Further Amendment; Termination - This Amendment constitutes an amendment to the ToS; language in the ToS indicating it may not be modified or that it alone is the entire agreement between the Parties is waived. If there is any conflict between this Amendment and the ToS, or between this Amendment and other rules or policies on the Company site or services, this Amendment shall prevail. This Amendment may be further amended only upon written agreement executed by both Parties. Agency may close Agency's account and terminate this agreement at any time. Company may close Agency's account and terminate this agreement on 30 days written notice, but the Agency shall not be entitled to a refund of any fees paid. Posting and availability of this Amendment - The parties agree this Amendment contains no confidential or proprietary information, and either party may release it to the public at large. ",

When you create a new organization, third-party applications are restricted by default. Organization admins can disable third-party application restrictions at any time.

      "category": "Site Policy",
      "category_url": "/categories/site-policy",
      "url": "/articles/dmca-takedown-policy",
      "body": "Welcome to GitHub's Guide to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, commonly known as the \"DMCA.\" This page is not meant as a comprehensive primer to the statute. However, if you've received a DMCA takedown notice targeting content you've posted on GitHub or if you're a rights-holder looking to issue such a notice, this page will hopefully help to demystify the law a bit as well as our policies for complying with it. (If you just want to submit a notice, you can skip to the end.) As with all legal matters, it is always best to consult with a professional about your specific questions or situation. We strongly encourage you to do so before taking any action that might impact your rights. This guide isn't legal advice and shouldn't be taken as such.  What Is the DMCA? In order to understand the DMCA and some of the policy lines it draws, it's perhaps helpful to consider life before it was enacted. Before the DMCA, an Internet-based service provider like GitHub could be liable for copyright infringement in the United States just for hosting its users' pictures, music, videos or code. This was true even if it had no actual knowledge of any infringing content. This was a problem, since even a single claim of copyright infringement can carry statutory damages of up to $150,000. With potential damages that high multiplied across millions of users, cloud-computing and user-generated content sites like YouTube, Facebook or GitHub probably never would have existed (or at least not without passing some of that cost downstream to their users). The DMCA attempted to fix this problem by creating a so-called copyright liability \"safe harbor\" for internet service providers hosting allegedly infringing user-generated content. (See U.S. Code, Title 17, Section 512.) Essentially, so long as a service provider follows the DMCA's notice-and-takedown rules, it won't be liable for copyright infringement based on user-generated content. Because of this it is important for GitHub to maintain its DMCA safe-harbor status.  DMCA Notices In a Nutshell The DMCA provides two simple, straightforward procedures that all GitHub users should know about: (i) a takedown-notice procedure for copyright holders to request that content be removed; and (ii) a counter-notice procedure for users to get content reenabled when content is taken down by mistake. DMCA takedown notices are used by copyright owners to ask GitHub to take down infringing content. If you are a software designer or developer, you create copyrighted content every day. If someone else is using your copyrighted content in an unauthorized manner on GitHub you can send us a DMCA takedown notice to request that the infringing content be changed or removed. On the other hand, counter notices can be used to correct mistakes. Maybe the person sending the takedown notice does not hold the copyright or did not realize that you have a license or made some other mistake in their takedown notice. Since GitHub usually cannot know if there has been a mistake, the DMCA counter notice allows you to let us know and ask that we put the content back up.  A. How Does This Actually Work? The DMCA framework is a bit like passing notes in class. The copyright owner hands GitHub a complaint about a user. If it's written correctly, we pass the complaint along to the user. If the user disputes the complaint, they can pass a note back saying so. GitHub exercises little discretion in the process other than determining whether the notices meet the minimum requirements of the DMCA. It is up to the parties (and their lawyers) to evaluate the merit of their claims, bearing in mind that notices must be made under penalty of perjury. Here are the basic steps in the process.   Copyright Owner Investigates. A copyright owner should always conduct an initial investigation to confirm both (a) that they own the copyright to an original work and (b) that the content on GitHub is unauthorized and infringing.  Example: An employee of Acme Web Company finds some of the company's code in a GitHub repository. Acme Web Company licenses its source code out to several trusted partners. Before sending in a take-down notice, Acme should review those licenses and its agreements to confirm that the code on GitHub is not authorized under any of them.   Copyright Owner Sends A Notice. After conducting an investigation, a copyright owner prepares and sends a takedown notice to GitHub. Assuming the takedown notice is sufficiently detailed according to the statutory requirements (as explained in the how-to guide), we will post the notice to our public repository and pass the link along to the affected user. GitHub Asks User to Make Changes. If the notice alleges that the entire contents of a repository infringe, we will skip to Step 6 and disable the entire repository expeditiously. Otherwise, because GitHub cannot disable access to specific files within a repository, we will contact the user who created the repository and give them approximately 24 hours to delete or modify the content specified in the notice. We'll notify the copyright owner if and when we give the user a chance to make changes. User Notifies GitHub of Changes. If the user chooses to make the specified changes, they must tell us so within the approximately 24-hour window. If they don't, we will disable the repository (as described in Step 6). If the user notifies us that they made changes, we will verify that the changes have been made and then notify the copyright owner. Copyright Owner Revises or Retracts the Notice. If the user makes changes, the copyright owner must review them and renew or revise their takedown notice if the changes are insufficient. GitHub will not take any further action unless the copyright owner contacts us to either renew the original takedown notice or submit a revised one. If the copyright owner is satisfied with the changes, they may either submit a formal retraction or else do nothing. GitHub will interpret silence longer than two weeks as an implied retraction of the takedown notice. GitHub May Disable Access to the Content. GitHub will disable a user's content if: (i) the copyright owner has alleged copyright over the user's entire repository (as noted in Step 3); (ii) the user has not made any changes after being given an opportunity to do so (as noted in Step 4); or (iii) the copyright owner has renewed their takedown notice after the user had a chance to make changes. If the copyright owner chooses instead to revise the notice, we will go back to Step 2 and repeat the process as if the revised notice were a new notice. User May Send A Counter Notice. We encourage users who have had content disabled to consult with a lawyer about their options. If a user believes that their content was disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification, they may send us a counter notice. As with the original notice, we will make sure that the counter notice is sufficiently detailed (as explained in the how-to guide). If it is, we will post it to our public repository and pass the notice back to the copyright owner by sending them the link. Copyright Owner May File a Legal Action. If a copyright owner wishes to keep the content disabled after receiving a counter notice, they will need to initiate a legal action seeking a court order to restrain the user from engaging in infringing activity relating to the content on GitHub. In other words, you might get sued. If the copyright owner does not give GitHub notice within 10-14 days, by sending a copy of a valid legal complaint filed in a court of competent jurisdiction, GitHub will reenable the disabled content.   B. What About Forks? (or What's a Fork?) One of the best features of Git is the ability for users to \"fork\" one another's repositories. What does that mean? In essence, it means that users can make a copy of a project and then make changes to that copy to either push back to the main project or just keep as their own variation of a project. We call each of these copies a \"fork\" of the original repository, which in turn may also be called the \"parent\" of the fork. GitHub will not automatically disable forks when disabling a parent repository. This is because forks belong to different users, may have been altered in significant ways, and may be licensed or used in a different way that is protected by the fair-use doctrine. GitHub does not conduct any independent investigation into forks. We expect copyright owners to conduct that investigation and, if they believe that the forks are also infringing, expressly include forks in their takedown notice.  C. What If I Inadvertently Missed the Window to Make Changes? We recognize that there are many valid reasons that you may not be able to make changes within the approximate 24-hour window we provide before your repository gets disabled. Maybe our message got flagged as spam, maybe you were on vacation, maybe you don't check that email account regularly, or maybe you were just busy. We get it. If you respond to let us know that you would have liked to make the changes, but somehow missed the first opportunity, we will re-enable the repository one additional time for approximately 24 hours to allow you to make the changes. Again, you must notify us that you have made the changes in order to keep the repository enabled after that 24-hour window, as noted above in Step A.4. Please note that we will only provide this one additional chance.  D. Transparency We believe that transparency is a virtue. The public should know what content is being removed from GitHub and why. An informed public can notice and surface potential issues that would otherwise go unnoticed in an opaque system. We post redacted copies of any legal notices we receive (including original notices, counter notices or retractions) at https://github.com/github/dmca. We will not publicly publish your personal contact information; we will remove personal information (except for usernames in URLs) before publishing notices. We will not, however, redact any other information from your notice unless you specifically ask us to. Here are some examples of a published notice and counter notice for you to see what they look like. When we remove content, we will post a link to the related notice in its place. Please also note that, although we will not publicly publish unredacted notices, we may provide a complete unredacted copy of any notices we receive directly to any party whose rights would be affected by it.   E.

F. Submitting Notices If you are ready to submit a notice or a counter notice:  How to Submit a DMCA Notice How to Submit a DMCA Counter Notice   Learn More and Speak Up If you poke around the Internet, it is not too hard to find commentary and criticism about the copyright system in general and the DMCA in particular. While GitHub acknowledges and appreciates the important role that the DMCA has played in promoting innovation online, we believe that the copyright laws could probably use a patch or two—if not a whole new release. In software, we are constantly improving and updating our code. Think about how much technology has changed since 1998 when the DMCA was written. Doesn't it just make sense to update these laws that apply to software? We don't presume to have all the answers. But if you are curious, here are a few links to scholarly articles and blog posts we have found with opinions and proposals for reform:   Unintended Consequences: Twelve Years Under the DMCA (Electronic Frontier Foundation)  Statutory Damages in Copyright Law: A Remedy in Need of Reform (William &amp; Mary Law Review)  Is the Term of Protection of Copyright Too Long?

      "body": " If you're cloning GitHub repositories using HTTPS, you can use a credential helper to tell Git to remember your GitHub username and password every time it talks to GitHub.  If you clone GitHub repositories using SSH, then you authenticate using SSH keys instead of a username and password. For help setting up an SSH connection, see Generating an SSH Key.   Tips:  You need Git 1.7.10 or newer to use the osxkeychain credential helper. If you installed Git using Homebrew, the osxkeychain helper will already be installed. If you're running Mac OS X 10.7 and above and you installed Git through Apple's Xcode Command Line Tools, then osxkeychain helper is automatically included in your Git installation.   Install Git and the osxkeychain helper and tell Git to use it.   Find out if Git and the osxkeychain helper are already installed:  git credential-osxkeychain # Test for the cred helper Usage: git credential-osxkeychain &lt;get|store|erase&gt;    If the osxkeychain helper isn't installed and you're running OS X version 10.9 or above, your computer will prompt you to download it as a part of the Xcode Command Line Tools:  git credential-osxkeychain xcode-select: note: no developer tools were found at '/Applications/Xcode.app', requesting install. Choose an option in the dialog to download the command line developer tools.  Alternatively, you can install Git and the osxkeychain helper by using Homebrew:  $ brew install git    Tell Git to use osxkeychain helper using the global credential.helper config:  git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain # Set git to use the osxkeychain credential helper    The next time you clone an HTTPS URL that requires a password, you'll be prompted for your username and password, and to grant access to the OSX keychain. After you've done this, the username and password are stored in your keychain and you won't be required to type them in to Git again.    Tip: You need Git 1.7.10 or newer to use the credential helper.  The credential helper is included with GitHub Desktop. The app also provides a Git shell so you won't ever need to install and configure Git manually. For more information, see \"Getting Started with GitHub Desktop.\" If you prefer working with the command line, you can also install a native Git shell, such as Git for Windows. With Git for Windows, running the following in the command line will store your credentials:  git config --global credential.helper wincred     Tip: You need Git 1.7.10 or newer to use the credential helper.  Turn on the credential helper so that Git will save your password in memory for some time. By default, Git will cache your password for 15 minutes.   In Terminal, enter the following:  git config --global credential.helper cache # Set git to use the credential memory cache    To change the default password cache timeout, enter the following:  git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600' # Set the cache to timeout after 1 hour (setting is in seconds)       Tip: You need Git 1.7.10 or newer to use the credential helper.

Review this information carefully! You can always say no, and deny access to the application.  Tip: You must verify your email address before you can authorize a third-party application.   Contacting the application developer Because an application is developed by a third-party who isn't GitHub, we don't know exactly how an application uses the data it's requesting access to. You can use the developer information at the top of the page to contact the application admin if you have questions or concerns about their application.  If the developer has chosen to supply it, the right-hand side of the page provides a detailed description of the application, as well as its associated website.   Types of application access and data Applications can have read or write access to your GitHub data.   Read access only allows an application to look at your data.  Write access allows an application to change your data.   About OAuth scopes Scopes are named groups of permissions that an application can request to access both public and non-public data. When you want to use a third-party application that integrates with GitHub, that application lets you know what type of access to your data will be required. If you grant access to the application, then the application will be able to perform actions on your behalf, such as reading or modifying data. For example, if you want to use an application that requests user:email scope, the application will have read-only access to your private email addresses. For more information, see OAuth Scopes in the GitHub Developer Documentation.  Note: Currently, you can't scope source code access to read-only.   Types of requested data There are several types of data that applications can request.   Tip: We recommend that you regularly review your authorized applications list. Remove any applications and tokens that haven't been used in a while.   Personal user data User data includes information found in your user profile, like your name, e-mail address, and location.  Repositories Repository information includes the names of contributors, the branches you've created, and the actual files within your repository. Applications can request access for either public or private repositories on a user-wide level. This is one of the most expansive configurations you can permit, so accept it with caution!  Repository Delete Applications can request to delete repositories that you administer, but they won't have access to your code at all. Deployments Deployment status access allows applications to determine if a deployment is successful against a specific commit for public and private repositories. Applications won't have access to your code. Commit status You can grant access for a third-party application to report your commit status. Commit status access allows applications to determine if a build is a successful against a specific commit. Applications won't have access to your code, but they can read and write status information against a specific commit. Notifications Notification access allows applications to read your GitHub notifications, such as comments on issues and pull requests. However, applications remain unable to access anything in your repositories. Gists  Gist access allows applications to read or write to both your public and secret Gists. Hooks  Webhooks access allows applications to read or write hook configurations on repositories you manage.   Requesting updated permissions Applications can request new access privileges. When asking for updated permissions, the application will notify you of the differences.   Third-party applications and organizations When you authorize a third-party application for your personal user account, you'll also see how the authorization will affect each organization you're a member of.  For organizations with third-party application restrictions, you can request that organization admins approve the application for use in that organization. If the organization does not approve the application, then the application will only be able to access the organization's public resources. If you're an organization admin, you can approve the application yourself. For organizations without third-party application restrictions, the application will automatically be authorized for access to that organization's resources. For this reason, you should be careful about which third-party applications you approve for access to your personal account resources as well as any organization resources.

That is, the history for a single file may omit commits found on the repository's commit history. In essence, Git has several different ways of showing the history of a repository. When Git shows the history of a single file, it \"simplifies\" history by omitting commits that did not change the file. But rather than look at every commit to decide whether it touched the file, git will omit a whole branch if that branch, when merged, did not impact the final contents of the file. Any commits on that branch that touched the file will not be shown. For a file's commit history, GitHub explicitly follows this simple strategy, for two reasons:  It makes the history simpler by removing commits that did not actually contribute to the final result ( e.g., if a side branch made a change and then reverted it, or if a side branch contains a messy version of some changes that were cherry-picked and cleaned up) It's significantly more efficient to compute, as we can avoid looking at whole side-branches of the history that did not impact the file  Of course, this truncated view might not always contain the information you're after. Sometimes, you do want to know about failed experiments, or messy history, or even be finding out what went wrong in a questionable merge. As mentioned above, Git does have many ways of viewing history, and GitHub provides a view with more information on a repository's commits page.

A README is often the first item a visitor will see when visiting your repository. README files typically include information on:  What the project does Why the project is useful How users can get started with the project Where users can get help with your project Who maintains and contributes to the project  If you put your README file in your repository's root directory, GitHub will recognize and automatically surface your README to repository visitors.   Section links in README files and blob pages Many projects use a table of contents at the start of a README to direct users to different sections of the file. You can link directly to a section in a rendered file by hovering over the section heading to expose the link:   Relative links and image paths in README files You can define relative links and image paths in your rendered files to help readers navigate to other files in your repository. A relative link is a link that is relative to the current file. For example, if you have a README file in root of your repository, and you have another file in docs/CONTRIBUTING.md, the relative link to CONTRIBUTING.md in your README might look like this: [Contribution guidelines for this project](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)  GitHub will automatically transform your relative link or image path based on whatever branch you're currently on, so that the link or path always works. You can use all relative link operands, such as ./ and ../. Relative links are easier for users who clone your repository. Absolute links may not work in clones of your repository - we recommend using relative links to refer to other files within your repository.

If you disable 2FA you will automatically lose access to the organization and any private forks you have of the organization's private repositories. To regain access to the organization and your forks, re-enable two-factor authentication and contact an organization owner.    You must have already configured 2FA via a TOTP mobile app or via SMS.

      "body": " Gists are a great way to share your work. You can share single files, parts of files, or full applications. You can access gists at https://gist.github.com.  Every gist is a Git repository, which means that it can be forked and cloned. The gist editor is powered by CodeMirror.   Types of gists There are two types of gists: public gists and secret gists. Additionally, if you are not logged into GitHub when you create your gist, it will be an anonymous gist. For steps on creating gists, see \"Creating gists.\"  Public gists Public gists show up in Discover, where people can browse new gists as they're created. They're also searchable, so you can use them if you'd like other people to find and see your work. After creating a gist, you cannot convert it from public to secret, or from secret to public.  Secret gists Secret gists don't show up in Discover and are not searchable. Use them to jot down an idea that came to you in a dream, create a to-do list, or prepare some code or prose that's not ready to be shared with the world. After creating a gist, you cannot convert it from public to secret, or from secret to public. Secret gists aren't private. If you send the URL of a secret gist to a friend, they'll be able to see it. However, if someone you don't know discovers the URL, they'll also be able to see your gist. If you need to keep your code away from prying eyes, you may want to create a private repository instead.  Anonymous gists If you create a gist without logging into GitHub, it will be an anonymous gist. Anonymous gists can be public or secret.  Warning: Anonymous gists cannot be deleted from the web browser. To have an anonymous gist deleted, contact GitHub Support. Please provide the URL of the gist you wish to delete.   Discovering and searching for other people's gists You can discover gists others have created by going to the gist home page and clicking All Gists. This will take you to a page of all gists sorted and displayed by time of creation or update. You can also search gists by language with Gist Search. Gist search uses the same search syntax as code search.  Forking and cloning gists Since gists are Git repositories, you can view their full commit history, complete with diffs. You can also fork or clone gists. For more information, see \"Forking and cloning gists\".  Downloading gists You can download a ZIP file of a gist by clicking the Download ZIP button at the top of the gist.   Embedding gists You can embed a gist in any text field that supports Javascript, such as a blog post. To get the embed code, click the clipboard icon next to the Embed URL of a gist.  To embed a specific gist file, append the Embed URL with ?file=FILENAME.  Further reading  \"Creating gists\" \"Forking and cloning gists\" ",

Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers advanced templating features, the option to quickly create a new Jekyll site with the Jekyll Theme Chooser, and Jekyll theme support. Although GitHub Pages was designed to work with any static site generator, using Jekyll offers a lot of built-in support and is the only static site generator GitHub officially documents in detail. For more information on how you can use GitHub Pages with another static site generator, see \"Using a static site generator other than Jekyll.\" The main advantages of Jekyll are:  You can use Markdown instead of HTML. Markdown is simpler to read and write. You can add a Jekyll theme to your site without copying CSS files. You can quickly create a new site using the Jekyll Theme Chooser. You can use common templates, such as headers and footers, that are shared across files. You can use a simplified build process to build your site with GitHub Pages.   Jekyll's build process Jekyll's simplified build process with GitHub Pages is one of the biggest advantages of using Jekyll instead of other static site generators. GitHub Pages manages your site's build process with a single push to your site's publishing branch. This is Jekyll's build process for managing your site:  Push file changes to your pages publishing branch GitHub Pages publishes your site.   Note: The publishing branch you use depends on the type of GitHub Pages site you have.  For User or Organization pages, use the master branch. For Project pages, use the gh-pages or master branch. Alternatively, you can also publish your site from a /docs folder on the master branch. For more information, see \"Configuring a publishing source for GitHub Pages.\"    Jekyll site examples Jekyll is the most commonly used static site generator for GitHub Pages. We recommend using Jekyll if you want the built-in support it offers, including the GitHub Pages gem to manage dependencies, specific build failure messages, and more specific help with troubleshooting.

      "body": "After a pull request is opened, anyone with read access can review and comment on the changes it proposes. Repository owners and collaborators can also request a pull request review from a specific person. Reviews allow for discussion of proposed changes and help ensure that the changes meet the repository's contributing guidelines and other quality standards.  A review has three possible statuses:   Comment: Submit general feedback without explicitly approving the changes or requesting additional changes.  Approve: Submit feedback and approve merging the changes proposed in the pull request.  Request changes: Submit feedback that must be addressed before the pull request can be merged.    Tips:  If required reviews are enabled and a collaborator with write, admin, or owner access to the repository submits a review requesting changes, the pull request cannot be merged until the same collaborator submits another review approving the changes in the pull request. Repository owners and administrators can merge a pull request even if it hasn't received an approved review, or if a reviewer who requested changes has left the organization or is unavailable.  If both required reviews and stale review dismissal are enabled and a code-modifying commit is pushed to the branch of an approved pull request, the approval is dismissed. The pull request must be reviewed and approved again before it can be merged. When several open pull requests each have a head branch pointing to the same commit, you won’t be able to merge them if one or both have a pending or rejected review.   You can view all of the reviews a pull request has received in the Conversation timeline, and you can see reviews by repository owners and collaborators in the pull request's merge box.   Required reviews Repository administrators can require that all pull requests receive at least one approved review from someone with write or admin permissions before they're merged into the default branch. For more information, see \"About protected branches.\" When required reviews are enabled, anyone with access to the repository can approve changes in a pull request. However, to merge your pull request you need someone who has write or admin permissions in the repository to approve your pull request's changes in their review.

Transferring to another organization The user transferring a repository must have owner or admin permissions in both organizations to complete a repository transfer. Once a repository is transferred to an organization, the organization's default repository permission settings will apply to the transferred repository. For example, if your default repository permission settings allow organization members read/write access, then all organization members can clone, pull, and push all repositories, including transferred repositories. Outside collaborators will still have access to the transferred repository and users with admin or owner access can invite more members or outside collaborators and adjust their permissions.

      "category_url": "/categories/search",
      "url": "/articles/searching-repositories",
      "body": " To search for repositories, use the following search qualifiers in any combination.   Tips:  There's a list of search syntaxes you can add to any search qualifier to further improve your results. Use quotations around your multi-word search terms. For example, if you want to search for issues with the label \"In progress,\" you'd search for label:\"in progress\". Search is not case sensitive.    Scope the search fields The in qualifier limits what fields are searched. With this qualifier you can restrict the search to just the repository name, description, README, or any combination of these. Without the qualifier, only the name and description are searched.  jquery in:name Matches repositories with jquery in their name. jquery in:name,description Matches repositories with jquery in their name or description. jquery in:readme Matches repositories mentioning jquery in their README file.   Search based on the size of a repository The size qualifier finds repositories that match a certain size (in kilobytes). For example:  size:1000 Matches repositories that are 1 MB exactly. size:&gt;=30000 Matches repositories that are at least 30 MB. size:&lt;50 Matches repositories that are smaller than 50 KB. size:50..120 Matches repositories that are between 50 KB and 120 KB.   Search based on the number of forks the parent repository has There are two ways to find repositories with forks. The first specifies the number of forks a repository should have:  forks:5 Matches repositories with only five forks. forks:&gt;=205 Matches repositories that with at least 205 forks. forks:&lt;90 Matches repositories with fewer than 90 forks. forks:10..20 Matches repositories with 10 to 20 forks.  The second way is to specify whether forked repositories should be included in results at all. By default, forked repositories are not shown. You can choose to include forked repositories by adding fork:true to your search. Or, if you only want forked repositories, add fork:only to your search. For example:  github fork:true Matches all repositories containing the word \"github,\" including forked ones. github fork:only Matches all repositories that are forked containing the word \"github\". github Matches all repositories that contain the word \"github,\" that are not forks.  You can, of course, combine both options:  forks:&gt;500 fork:only Matches repositories with more than 500 forks, and only returns those forks.   Search based on when a repository was created or last updated You can filter repositories based on time of creation or time of last update. For repository creation, you can use the created qualifier; to find out when a repository was last updated, you'll want to use the pushed qualifier. The pushed qualifier will return a list of repositories, sorted by the most recent commit made on any branch in the repository. Both take a date as a parameter. Date formatting must follow the ISO8601 standard, which is YYYY-MM-DD--that's year-month-day. You may also add some optional time information, formatted as THH:MM:SS+07:00--that's hour-minutes-seconds (HH:MM:SS), followed by a UTC offset (+07:00) Dates support greater than, less than, and range qualifiers. For example:  webos created:&lt;2011-01-01 Matches repositories with the word \"webos\" that were created before 2011. css pushed:&lt;2013-02-01 Matches repositories with the word \"css\" that were pushed to before February 2013. case pushed:&gt;=2013-03-06 fork:only Matches repositories with the word \"case\" that were pushed to on or after March 6th, 2013, and that are forks.   Search within a user's or organization's repositories To grab a list of a user's or organization's repositories, you can use the user qualifier. For example:  user:github Matches repositories from GitHub. user:defunkt forks:&gt;100 Matches repositories from @defunkt that have more than 100 forks.   Search by repository topic You can find all of the repositories that are classified with a particular topic.  topic:jekyll Matches repositories that have been classified with the topic \"jekyll\".   Search based on the number of topics a repository has You can find repositories by the number of applied topics.  topics:&gt;3 Matches repositories that have more than three topics.   topics:5 Matches repositories that have five topics.   Search based on the main language of a repository You can also search repositories based on what language they're written in. For example:  rails language:javascript Matches repositories with the word \"rails\" that are written in JavaScript.   Search based on the number of stars a repository has You can choose to search repositories based on the number of stars, or watchers, a repository has. For example:  stars:10..20 Matches repositories 10 to 20 stars, that are smaller than 1000 KB. stars:&gt;=500 fork:true language:php Matches repositories with the at least 500 stars, including forked ones, that are written in PHP.   Sort the results With any of the qualifiers above, you can also choose to sort on these properties:  Number of stars Number of forks Date of last update  These can be in ascending or descending order.",

      "url": "/articles/about-repository-transfers",
      "body": " Warning:   Forking a repository is NOT the same as transferring it. Forking just creates a copy of the original repository.  If you create a new repository under your account with the same name as the transferred repository, existing redirects to the transferred repository will break. Instead, use a different name for the new repository.   Before you transfer a repository, keep these things in mind:  When the current owner initiates the transfer, the new owner will receive an email giving the option to accept or reject the transfer. If the new owner doesn't accept the transfer within one day, it won't complete. The target account must not have a repository with the same name, or a fork in the same network. The original owner of the repository is added as a collaborator on the transferred repository. Other collaborators to the transferred repository remain intact. Private forks can't be transferred.   What's transferred with a repository? When you transfer a repository, its issues, wiki, stars, and watchers are also transferred. In addition:   If the transferred repository is a fork, then it remains associated with the upstream repository.  If the transferred repository contains a GitHub Pages site, then links to the Git repository on the Web and through Git activity are redirected. However, we don't redirect GitHub Pages associated with the repository.  If the transferred repository contains webhooks, services, or deploy keys, they will remain associated after the transfer is complete.  If the transferred repository has any forks, then those forks will remain associated with the repository after the transfer is complete.  If the transferred repository uses Git Large File Storage, all Git LFS objects are automatically moved. This transfer occurs in the background so if you have a large number of Git LFS objects or if the Git LFS objects themselves are large, it may take some time for the transfer to occur. Before you transfer a repository that uses Git LFS, make sure the receiving account has enough data packs to store the Git LFS objects you'll be moving over. For more information on adding storage for personal accounts, see \"Purchasing additional storage and bandwidth for a personal account.\"  All Git information about commits, including contributions, are preserved.  All of the issues and pull requests remain intact when transferring a repository.  All links to the previous repository location are automatically redirected to the new location. When you use git clone, git fetch, or git push on a transferred repository, these commands will redirect to the new repository location or URL. However, to avoid confusion, we strongly recommend updating any existing local clones to point to the new repository URL. You can do this by using git remote on the command line:  $ git remote set-url origin new_url  For more information, see \"Changing a remote's URL\".

      "category_url": "/categories/site-policy",
      "url": "/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-counter-notice",
      "body": "This guide describes the information that GitHub needs in order to process a counter notice to a DMCA takedown request. If you have more general questions about what the DMCA is or how GitHub processes DMCA takedown requests, please review our DMCA Takedown Policy. If you believe your content on GitHub was mistakenly disabled by a DMCA takedown request, you have the right to contest the takedown by submitting a counter notice. If you do, we will wait 10-14 days and then re-enable your content unless the copyright owner initiates a legal action against you before then. Our counter-notice form, set forth below, is consistent with the form suggested by the DMCA statute, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office's official website: http://www.copyright.gov. As with all legal matters, it is always best to consult with a professional about your specific questions or situation. We strongly encourage you to do so before taking any action that might impact your rights. This guide isn't legal advice and shouldn't be taken as such.  Before You Start Tell the Truth. The DMCA requires that you swear to your counter notice under penalty of perjury. It is a federal crime to intentionally lie in a sworn declaration. (See U.S. Code, Title 18, Section 1621.) Submitting false information could also result in civil liability—that is, you could get sued for money damages. Investigate. Submitting a DMCA counter notice can have real legal consequences. If the complaining party disagrees that their takedown notice was mistaken, they might decide to file a lawsuit against you to keep the content disabled. You should conduct a thorough investigation into the allegations made in the takedown notice and probably talk to a lawyer before submitting a counter notice. You Must Have a Good Reason to Submit a Counter Notice. In order to file a counter notice, you must have \"a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.\" (U.S. Code, Title 17, Section 512(g).) Whether you decide to explain why you believe there was a mistake is up to you and your lawyer, but you do need to identify a mistake before you submit a counter notice. In the past, we have received counter notices citing mistakes in the takedown notice such as: the complaining party doesn't have the copyright; I have a license; the code has been released under an open-source license that permits my use; or the complaint doesn't account for the fact that my use is protected by the fair-use doctrine. Of course, there could be other defects with the takedown notice. Copyright Laws Are Complicated. Sometimes a takedown notice might allege infringement in a way that seems odd or indirect. Copyright laws are complicated and can lead to some unexpected results. In some cases a takedown notice might allege that your source code infringes because of what it can do after it is compiled and run. For example:  The law says that it is infringement to distribute software that is used to circumvent access controls to copyrighted works.  Sometimes distributing software can be copyright infringement, if you induce end users to use the software to infringe copyrighted works. A copyright complaint might also be based on non-literal copying of design elements in the software, rather than the source code itself—in other words, they think your design looks too similar to theirs.  These are just a few examples of the complexities of copyright law. Since there are many nuances to the law and some unsettled questions in these types of cases, it is especially important to get professional advice if the infringement allegations do not seem straightforward. A Counter Notice Is A Legal Statement. We require you to fill out all fields of a counter notice completely, because a counter notice is a legal statement — not just to us, but to the complaining party. As we mentioned above, if the complaining party wishes to keep the content disabled after receiving a counter notice, they will need to initiate a legal action seeking a court order to restrain you from engaging in infringing activity relating to the content on GitHub. In other words, you might get sued (and you consent to that in the counter notice). Your Counter Notice Will Be Published. As noted in our DMCA Takedown Policy, after redacting personal information, we publish all complete and actionable counter notices at https://github.com/github/dmca. Please also note that, although we will only publicly publish redacted notices, we may provide a complete unredacted copy of any notices we receive directly to any party whose rights would be affected by it. If you are concerned about your privacy, you may have a lawyer or other legal representative file the counter notice on your behalf. GitHub Isn't The Judge. GitHub exercises little discretion in this process other than determining whether the notices meet the minimum requirements of the DMCA. It is up to the parties (and their lawyers) to evaluate the merit of their claims, bearing in mind that notices must be made under penalty of perjury. Additional Resources. If you need additional help, there are many self-help resources online. Lumen has an informative set of guides on copyright and DMCA safe harbor. If you are involved with an open-source project in need of legal advice, you can contact the Software Freedom Law Center. And if you think you have a particularly challenging case, non-profit organizations such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation may also be willing to help directly or refer you to a lawyer.  Your Counter Notice Must...  Include the following statement: \"I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Counter Notice.\" We won't refuse to process an otherwise complete counter notice if you don't include this statement; however, we will know that you haven't read these guidelines and may ask you to go back and do so. Identify the content that was disabled and the location where it appeared. The disabled content should have been identified by URL in the takedown notice. You simply need to copy the URL(s) that you want to challenge. Provide your contact information. Include your email address, name, telephone number, and physical address. Include the following statement: \"I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.\" You may also choose to communicate the reasons why you believe there was a mistake or misidentification. If you think of your counter notice as a \"note\" to the complaining party, this is a chance to explain why they should not take the next step and file a lawsuit in response. This is yet another reason to work with a lawyer when submitting a counter notice. Include the following statement: \"I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.\" Include your physical or electronic signature.   How to Submit Your Counter Notice The fastest way to get a response is to enter your information and answer all the questions on our Copyright claims form. You can also send an email notification to copyright@github.com. You may include an attachment if you like, but please also include a plain-text version of your letter in the body of your message. If you must send your notice by physical mail, you can do that too, but it will take substantially longer for us to receive and respond to it—and the 10-14 day waiting period starts from when we receive your counter notice. Notices we receive via plain-text email have a much faster turnaround than PDF attachments or physical mail. If you still wish to mail us your notice, our physical address is: GitHub, Inc Attn: DMCA Agent 88 Colin P Kelly Jr St San Francisco, CA. 94107 ",

      "body": " Choosing the right license We created choosealicense.com, to help you understand how to license your code. A software license tells others what they can and can't do with your source code, so it's important to make an informed decision. You're under no obligation to choose a license. However, without a license, the default copyright laws apply, meaning that you retain all rights to your source code and no one may reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from your work. If you're creating an open source project, we strongly encourage you to include an open source license. The Open Source Guide provides additional guidance on choosing the correct license for your project.  Note: If you publish your source code in a public repository on GitHub, according to the Terms of Service, other GitHub users have the right to view and fork your repository within the GitHub site. If you have already created a public repository and no longer want users to have access to it, you can make your repository private. When you convert a public repository to a private repository, existing forks or local copies created by other users will still exist. For more information, see \"Making a public repository private.\"   Determining the location of your license Most people place their license text in a file named LICENSE.txt (or LICENSE.md) in the root of the repository; here's an example from Hubot. Some projects include information about their license in their README. For example, a project's README may include a note saying \"This project is licensed under the terms of the MIT license.\" As a best practice, we encourage you to include the license file with your project.  Searching GitHub by license type You can use code search to find projects with a certain license file. You must be logged in to search code. For example, here's a search for projects licensed under the GNU General Public License.  Detecting a license The open source Ruby gem Licensee compares the repository's LICENSE file to a short list of known licenses. Licensee also provides the Licenses API and gives us insight into how repositories on GitHub are licensed. If your repository is using a license that isn't listed on the Choose a License website, you can request including the license. If your repository is using a license that is listed on the Choose a License website and it's not displaying clearly at the top of the repository page, it may contain multiple licenses or other complexity. To have your license detected, simplify your LICENSE file and note the complexity somewhere else, such as your repository's README file.  Applying a license to a repository with an existing license The license picker is only available when you create a new project on GitHub. You can manually add a license using the browser. For more information on adding a license to a repository, see \"Adding a license to a repository.\"  If you need to add licenses to a large number of repositories, the website addalicense.com may help automate this process. However, please note that the site is not owned by or affiliated with GitHub, so we can't guarantee it'll work in all cases.  Disclaimer The goal of GitHub's open source licensing efforts is to provide a starting point to help you make an informed choice. GitHub displays license information to help users get information about open source licenses and the projects that use them. We hope it helps, but please keep in mind that we’re not lawyers and that we make mistakes like everyone else. For that reason, GitHub provides the information on an “as-is” basis and makes no warranties regarding any information or licenses provided on or through it, and disclaims liability for damages resulting from using the license information. If you have any questions regarding the right license for your code or any other legal issues relating to it, it’s always best to consult with a professional.

Commits Commits will appear on your contributions graph if they meet all of the following conditions:  The email address used for the commits is associated with your GitHub account. The commits were made in a standalone repository, not a fork. The commits were made:  In the repository's default branch (usually master) In the gh-pages branch (for repositories with Project Pages sites)    In addition, at least one of the following must be true:  You are a collaborator on the repository or are a member of the organization that owns the repository. You have forked the repository. You have opened a pull request or issue in the repository. You have starred the repository.   Common reasons that contributions are not counted  Notes:  When a pull request is merged and commits are squashed, only the user that merged the pull request and the user that opened the pull request receive contribution credit. No other contributors to the pull request will receive contribution credit. When rebasing commits, the original author of the commit and the person who rebased the commits, whether on the command line or on GitHub, receives contribution credit.    You haven't added your local Git commit email to your profile Commits must be made with an email address that has been added to your GitHub profile in order to appear on your contributions graph. You can check the email address used for a commit by adding .patch to the end of a commit URL, e.g. https://github.com/octocat/octocat.github.io/commit/67c0afc1da354d8571f51b6f0af8f2794117fd10.patch: From 67c0afc1da354d8571f51b6f0af8f2794117fd10 Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001 From: The Octocat &lt;octocat@nowhere.com&gt; Date: Sun, 27 Apr 2014 15:36:39 +0530 Subject: [PATCH] updated index for better welcome message  The email address in the From: field is the address that was set in the local git config settings. In this example, the email address used for the commit is octocat@nowhere.com. If the email address used for the commit hasn't been added to your GitHub profile, you must add the email address to your GitHub account. Your contributions graph will be rebuilt automatically when you add the new address.  Generic email addresses--such as jane@computer.local--cannot be added to GitHub accounts. If you use such an email for your commits, the commits will not be linked to your GitHub profile and will not show up in your contributions graph.   Commit was not made in the default or gh-pages branch Commits are only counted if they are made in the default branch (usually master) or the gh-pages branch (for repositories with Project Pages sites). If your commits are in a non-default or non-gh-pages branch and you'd like them to count toward your contributions, you will need to do one of the following:   Open a pull request to have your changes merged into the default branch or the gh-pages branch.  Change the default branch of the repository.   Changing the default branch of the repository will change it for all repository collaborators. Only do this if you want the new branch to become the base against which all future pull requests and commits will be made.   Commit was made in a fork Commits made in a fork will not count toward your contributions. To make them count, you must do one of the following:   Open a pull request to have your changes merged into the parent repository. To detach the fork and turn it into a standalone repository on GitHub, contact GitHub Support. If the fork has forks of its own, let support know if the forks should move with your repository into a new network or remain in the current network. For more information, see \"About forks.\"   Commit was made in a pull request that was merged and squashed Commits made in a pull request that was merged and squashed will not count toward your contributions. Only the user that merged the pull request and the user that opened the pull request receive contributions. No other contributors to the pull request will receive contribution credit.

      "body": "In this article:  Headings Styling text Quoting text Quoting code Links Section links Relative links Lists Task lists Mentioning users and teams Referencing issues and pull requests Using emoji Paragraphs and line breaks Ignoring Markdown formatting   Headings To create a heading, add one to six # symbols before your heading text. The number of # you use will determine the size of the heading. # The largest heading ## The second largest heading ###### The smallest heading    Styling text You can indicate emphasis with bold, italic, or strikethrough text.    Style Syntax Keyboard shortcut Example Output     Bold  ** ** or __ __  command/control + b **This is bold text** This is bold text   Italic  * * or _ _  command/control + i *This text is italicized* This text is italicized   Strikethrough ~~ ~~  ~~This was mistaken text~~ This was mistaken text   Bold and italic  ** ** and _ _   **This text is _extremely_ important** This text is extremely important     Quoting text You can quote text with a &gt;. In the words of Abraham Lincoln: &gt; Pardon my French    Tip: When viewing an issue or pull request, you can automatically quote text in a reply by highlighting the text, then typing r. For more information, see \"Using keyboard shortcuts.\"   Quoting code You can call out code or a command within a sentence with single backticks. The text within the backticks will not be formatted. Use `git status` to list all new or modified files that haven't yet been committed.  To format code or text into its own distinct block, use triple backticks.  Some basic Git commands are: ``` git status git add git commit ```   For more information, see \"Creating and highlighting code blocks.\"  Links You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets [ ], and then wrapping the URL in parentheses ( ). You can also use the keyboard shortcut command + k to create a link. This site was built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).   Tip: GitHub automatically creates links when valid URLs are written in a comment. For more information, see \"Autolinked references and URLS.\"   Section links You can link directly to a section in a rendered file by hovering over the section heading to expose the link:   Relative links You can define relative links and image paths in your rendered files to help readers navigate to other files in your repository. A relative link is a link that is relative to the current file. For example, if you have a README file in root of your repository, and you have another file in docs/CONTRIBUTING.md, the relative link to CONTRIBUTING.md in your README might look like this: [Contribution guidelines for this project](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)  GitHub will automatically transform your relative link or image path based on whatever branch you're currently on, so that the link or path always works. You can use all relative link operands, such as ./ and ../. Relative links are easier for users who clone your repository. Absolute links may not work in clones of your repository - we recommend using relative links to refer to other files within your repository.  Lists You can make a list by preceding one or more lines of text with - or *. - George Washington - John Adams - Thomas Jefferson   To order your list, precede each line with a number. 1. James Madison 2. James Monroe 3. John Quincy Adams   You can create nested lists by indenting lines by two spaces. 1. Make my changes 1. Fix bug 2. Improve formatting * Make the headings bigger 2. Push my commits to GitHub 3. Open a pull request * Describe my changes * Mention all the members of my team * Ask for feedback    Task lists To create a task list, preface list items with [ ]. To mark a task as complete, use [x]. - [x] Finish my changes - [ ] Push my commits to GitHub - [ ] Open a pull request   If a task list item description begins with a parenthesis, you'll need to escape it with \\: - [ ] \\(Optional) Open a followup issue For more information, see \"About task lists.\"  Mentioning users and teams You can mention a user or team on GitHub by typing @ plus their username or team name to trigger a notification and bring their attention to an issue or pull request. People will also receive a notification if you edit a comment to mention their username or team name. @github/support What do you think about these updates?  Typing an @ symbol will bring up a list of people or teams on a project. The list filters as you type, so once you find the name of the person or team you are looking for, you can use the arrow keys to select it and hit either tab or enter to complete the name. For teams, just enter the @organization/team-name and all members of that team will get subscribed to the issue. The autocomplete results are restricted to repository collaborators and any other participants on the thread.  Referencing issues and pull requests You can bring up a list of suggested Issues and Pull Requests within the repository by typing #. Type the issue or PR number or title to filter the list, then hit either tab or enter to complete the highlighted result. For more information, see \"Autolinked references and URLs.\"  Using emoji You can add emoji to your writing by typing :EMOJICODE:. @octocat :+1: This PR looks great - it's ready to merge! :shipit:  Typing : will bring up a list of suggested emoji. The list will filter as you type, so once you find the emoji you're looking for, press Tab or Enter to complete the highlighted result. For a full list of available emoji and codes, check out emoji-cheat-sheet.com.  Paragraphs and line breaks You can create a new paragraph by leaving a blank line between lines of text.  Ignoring Markdown formatting You can tell GitHub to ignore (or escape) Markdown formatting by using \\ before the Markdown character. Let's rename \\*our-new-project\\* to \\*our-old-project\\*.

Repository administrators can require that all pull requests receive at least one approved review from someone with write or admin permissions before they're merged into the default branch. For more information, see \"About protected branches.\" When required reviews are enabled, anyone with access to the repository can approve changes in a pull request. However, to merge your pull request you need someone who has write or admin permissions in the repository to approve your pull request's changes in their review. If a person with admin permissions chooses the Request changes option in a review, then that person must approve the pull request before it can be merged. If a reviewer who requests changes on a pull request isn't available, anyone with admin or write permission for the repository can dismiss the blocking review. For more information, see \"Dismissing a pull request review.\"  Note: Repository admins can restrict the ability to dismiss pull request reviews to specific people or teams. For more information, see \"Enabling required reviews for pull requests.\"  If you push a code-modifying commit to the branch of an approved pull request, the approval may be dismissed if repository admins have set up stale review dismissals. This doesn't apply if you push non-code-modifying commits, like merging the base branch into your pull request's branch. Unless required reviews have been set up to include repository admins, people with admin permissions can merge a pull request regardless of reviews from other admins. After all required reviewers have approved a pull request, you won't be able to merge it if there are other open pull requests with pending or rejected reviews and those pull requests have a head branch pointing to the same commit.

Need to report a security vulnerability? Please visit our security bug bounty site for information about our responsible disclosure process and to submit a vulnerability report.  Physical Security  Data center access limited to data center technicians and approved GitHub staff Biometric scanning for controlled data center access Security camera monitoring at all data center locations 24x7 onsite staff provides additional protection against unauthorized entry Unmarked facilities to help maintain low profile Physical security audited by an independent firm   System Security  System installation using hardened, patched OS Dedicated firewall and VPN services to help block unauthorized system access Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) mitigation services powered by industry-leading solutions   Operational Security  Our primary data center operations are regularly audited by independent firms against an ISAE 3000/AT 101 Type 2 Examination standard Systems access logged and tracked for auditing purposes Secure document-destruction policies for all sensitive information Fully documented change-management procedures   Software Security We employ a team of 24/7/365 server specialists at GitHub to keep our software and its dependencies up to date eliminating potential security vulnerabilities. We employ a wide range of monitoring solutions for preventing and eliminating attacks to the site.  Communications All private data exchanged with GitHub is always transmitted over SSL (which is why your dashboard is served over HTTPS, for instance). All pushing and pulling of private data is done over SSH authenticated with keys, or over HTTPS using your GitHub username and password. The SSH login credentials used to push and pull can not be used to access a shell or the filesystem. All users are virtual and have no user account on our machines.  File system and backups Every piece of hardware we use has an identical copy ready and waiting for an immediate hot-swap in case of hardware or software failure. Every line of code we store is saved on a minimum of three different servers, including an off-site backup. We do not retroactively remove repositories from backups when deleted by the user, as we may need to restore the repository for the user if it was removed accidentally. We do not encrypt repositories on disk because it would not be any more secure: the website and git back-end would need to decrypt the repositories on demand, slowing down response times. Any user with shell access to the file system would have access to the decryption routine, thus negating any security it provides. Therefore, we focus on making our machines and network as secure as possible.  Employee access No GitHub employees ever access private repositories unless required to for support reasons. Staff working directly in the file store access the compressed Git database, your code is never present as plaintext files like it would be in a local clone. Support staff may sign into your account to access settings related to your support issue. In rare cases staff may need to pull a clone of your code, this will only be done with your consent. Support staff does not have direct access to clone any repository, they will need to temporarily attach their SSH key to your account to pull a clone. When working a support issue we do our best to respect your privacy as much as possible, we only access the files and settings needed to resolve your issue. All cloned repositories are deleted as soon as the support issue has been resolved.  Maintaining security We protect your login from brute force attacks with rate limiting. All passwords are filtered from all our logs and are one-way encrypted in the database using bcrypt. Login information is always sent over SSL. We also allow you to use two-factor authentication, or 2FA, as an additional security measure when accessing your GitHub account. Enabling 2FA adds security to your account by requiring both your password as well as access to a security code on your phone to access your account. We have full time security staff to help identify and prevent new attack vectors. We always test new features in order to rule out potential attacks, such as XSS-protecting wikis, and ensuring that Pages cannot access cookies. We also maintain relationships with reputable security firms to perform regular penetration tests and ongoing audits of GitHub and its code. We're extremely concerned and active about security, but we're aware that many companies are not comfortable hosting code outside their firewall. For these companies we offer GitHub Enterprise, a version of GitHub that can be installed to a server within the company's network.  Credit card safety When you sign up for a paid account on GitHub, we do not store any of your card information on our servers. It's handed off to Braintree Payment Solutions, a company dedicated to storing your sensitive data on PCI-Compliant servers.  Contact Us Have a question, concern, or comment about GitHub security?

With GitHub Search, you can type in anything you're looking for and get highlighted results that match your search criteria. You can refine your search results by clicking on one of the languages or repositories listed in the sidebar.  Under the hood, we use an ElasticSearch cluster to index your projects every time you push to GitHub. Issues and pull requests are indexed when they are created or modified.  Types of Searches  Repositories When searching for repositories, you'll receive results for both public repositories and private repositories you have access to. Every repository result shows a participation graph in the background. This helps you scan the results for more active repositories. For more information, see \"Searching Repositories.\"   Issues You can search for issues across all the public and private repositories you have access to. You can restrict the search results to a single organization or you can show only those issues assigned to a single user. For more information, see \"Searching Issues.\"  Code Code search lets you explore the contents of public repositories and private repositories you can access. The results are syntax highlighted and include line numbers. For more information, see \"Searching Code.\"  Note: You must be logged in to search for code across all public repositories.   Commits You can search commits by message, author, committer, repository, or by repository owner. For more information, see \"Searching commits.\"  Users When searching for users, you'll be able to refine queries based on certain parameters, such as where they live and what languages they're interested in. You can also follow users directly from those results. For more information, see \"Searching Users.\"  Wikis You can search wikis by author, repository, update date, or wiki owner. For example, you can search all wikis owned by a certain user or organization. You can also limit your search scope to wiki pages or titles. For more information, see \"Searching wikis.\"  Sorting results By default, we sort results by \"best match.\" There are several other sort options for each specific search type that you can use instead. For example, for repositories, you can also choose to sort by the number of stars or the number of forks; for issues, you can sort by the creation or last updated date. For a complete list of sort options, refer to the help article for each individual search type.  Potential timeouts Some queries are computationally expensive for our search infrastructure to execute. To keep search fast for everyone, we limit how long any individual query can run. In rare situations when a query exceeds the time limit, search returns all matches that were found prior to the timeout and informs you that such a timeout happened:  Reaching a timeout does not necessarily mean that search results are incomplete. It just means that the query was discontinued before it searched through all possible data. More results might have been found, but also might not.  Limitations on query length There are some limits to the length of the queries when searching across GitHub:  Queries longer than 256 characters are not supported You can't construct a query using more than five AND, OR, or NOT operators  Specific search types, such as code search, might have additional limitations. Check the documentation for these search types for more information.  Further reading  \"Advanced search\" \"Search syntax\" ",

For example, instead of writing  Looking for a good developer  You may want to try something more descriptive:  Seeking bad-ass Ruby specialist for working on rockets   Job description  Position It's important to the reader of the job posting to understand everything they can about the position before contacting you. Try to answer the following questions in your job description:  What is the position all about? What are the intriguing aspects to the position? What will the candidate be responsible for? Will the candidate work with a great team or use some new tools?   Company You should try to describe what makes your company stand above all the others. What kind of culture do you have? For example, at GitHub, everyone manages their own time. Similar qualities could be something to include in your job post. When talking about your company, don't be shy. You should mention anything you are proud of and that differentiates your company from others.  Benefits Mentioning benefits will help demonstrate how much you care for employees. Talk about any health benefits for employees and their partners, as well as any general benefits to working for you.  Skills When listing skills, avoid including every available technology. Simply listing the main ones in order of importance will help potential candidates scan the list quickly. Ideally, someone who already does the job should proofread your posting and be able to answer the following questions:  What is a list of skills that makes sense considering the skill level of the candidate? What skills are mandatory? If there are secondary skills that you'd like candidates to have or to learn, how important are they?   Length The total length of the job post is something you should definitely think about. Shorter is always better. After writing your description, edit it down.  Format The format of your job post really matters. GitHub Jobs supports writing in the standard Markdown format. You should consider using bullet points, links, and headers to make your post more legible.",

If you have a very good reason you must use sudo, then ensure you are using it with every command (it's probably just better to use su to get a shell as root at that point).

If it does not print anything, you will need to generate a new SSH key and associate it with GitHub.  Tip: On most systems the default private keys (~/.ssh/id_rsa, ~/.ssh/id_dsa and ~/.ssh/identity) are automatically added to the SSH authentication agent. You shouldn't need to run ssh-add path/to/key unless you override the file name when you generate a key.   Getting more details You can also check that the key is being used by trying to connect to git@github.com:  ssh -vT git@github.com ... debug1: identity file /Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa type -1 debug1: identity file /Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa-cert type -1 debug1: identity file /Users/you/.ssh/id_dsa type -1 debug1: identity file /Users/you/.ssh/id_dsa-cert type -1 ... debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey debug1: Next authentication method: publickey debug1: Trying private key: /Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa debug1: Trying private key: /Users/you/.ssh/id_dsa debug1: No more authentication methods to try. Permission denied (publickey).  In that example, we did not have any keys for SSH to use. The \"-1\" at the end of the \"identity file\" lines means SSH couldn't find a file to use. Later on, the \"Trying private key\" lines also indicate that no file was found. If a file existed, those lines would be \"1\" and \"Offering public key\", respectively:  ssh -vT git@github.com ... debug1: identity file /Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa type 1 ... debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey debug1: Next authentication method: publickey debug1: Offering RSA public key: /Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa   Verify the public key is attached to your account You must provide your public key to GitHub to establish a secure connection.

Only owners can access an organization's audit log.  In the top right corner of GitHub, click your profile photo, then click Your profile.  On the left side of your profile page, under \"Organizations\", click the icon for your organization.  Under your organization name, click  Settings.  In the Settings sidebar, click Audit log.    Searching the audit log The audit log lists the following information about actions made within your organization:  Which repository an action was performed in The user that performed the action The action that was performed Which country the action took place in The date and time the action occurred  Note that you cannot search for audit entries using text. You can, however, construct search queries using a variety of filters. Many operators used when querying the audit log—such as -, &gt;, or &lt; —match the same format as searching across GitHub.  Search based on repository Use the repo qualifier to limit actions to a specific repository owned by your organization. For example:   repo:my-org/our-repo finds all events that occurred for the our-repo repository in the my-org organization.  repo:my-org/our-repo repo:my-org/another-repo finds all events that occurred for both the our-repo and another-repo repositories in the my-org organization.  -repo:my-org/not-this-repo excludes all events that occurred for the not-this-repo repository in the my-org organization.  Note that you must include your organization's name within the repo qualifier; searching for just repo:our-repo will not work.  Search based on the user The actor qualifier can scope events based on the member of your organization that performed the action. For example:   actor:octocat finds all events performed by octocat.  actor:octocat actor:hubot finds all events performed by both octocat and hubot.  -actor:hubot excludes all events performed by hubot.  Note that you can only use a GitHub username, not an individual's real name.  Search based on the action performed To search for specific events, use the action qualifier in your query. Actions listed in the audit log are grouped within the following categories:    Category Name Description     account Contains all activities related to your organization account.   billing Contains all activities related to your organization's billing.   hook Contains all activities related to webhooks.   org Contains all activities related organization membership   payment_method Contains all activities related to how your organization pays for GitHub.   profile_picture Contains all activities related to your organization's profile picture.   project Contains all activities related to project boards.   repo Contains all activities related to the repositories owned by your organization.   team Contains all activities related to teams in your organization.    You can search for specific sets of actions using these terms. For example:   action:team finds all events grouped within the team category.  -action:hook excludes all events in the webhook category.  Each category has a set of associated events that you can filter on. For example:   action:team.create finds all events where a team was created.  -action:hook.events_changed excludes all events where the events on a webhook have been altered.  This list describes the available categories and associated events:  The account category The billing category The hook category The org category The oauth_application category The payment_method category The profile_picture category The project category The repo category The team category   The account category    Action Description     billing_plan_change Triggered when an organization's billing cycle changes.   plan_change Triggered when an organization's billing plan changes.

Search based on time of action Use the created qualifier to filter actions in the audit log based on when they occurred. Date formatting must follow the ISO8601 standard, which is YYYY-MM-DD--that's year-month-day. You may also add some optional time information, formatted as THH:MM:SS+07:00--that's hour-minutes-seconds (HH:MM:SS), followed by a UTC offset (+07:00) Dates support greater than, less than, and range qualifiers. For example:   created:2014-07-08 finds all events that occurred on July 8th, 2014.  created:&gt;=2014-07-08 finds all events that occurred on or after July 8th, 2014.  created:&lt;=2014-07-08 finds all events that occurred on or before July 8th, 2014.  created:2014-07-01..2014-07-31 finds all events that occurred in the month of July 2014.  The audit log contains data for the past 90 days, but you can use the created qualifier to search for events earlier than that.  Search based on location Using the qualifier country, you can filter actions in the audit log based on the originating country. You can use a country's two-letter short code or its full name. Keep in mind that countries with spaces in their name will need to be wrapped in quotation marks. For example:   country:de finds all events that occurred in Germany.  country:Mexico finds all events that occurred in Mexico.  country:\"United States\" all finds events that occurred in the United States.   Exporting the audit log You can export your organization's audit log as JSON data or a comma-separated value (CSV) file, with or without a specified search.  When exporting the results of a specific search, these fields can be included:    key example value     action team.create   actor dewski   user shayfrendt   org octo-org   repo octo-org/documentation   created_at 1429548104000   data.hook_id 245   data.events [\"issues\", \"issue_comment\", \"pull_request\", \"pull_request_review_comment\"]   data.events_were [\"push\", \"pull_request\", \"issues\"]   data.target_login octocat   data.old_user hubot   data.team octo-org/engineering     Further reading  \"Keeping your organization secure\" ",

Creating a new repository  You can create a new repository on your personal account or any organization where you have sufficient permissions.  About READMEs  You can add a README file to your repository to tell other people why your project is useful, what they can do with your project, and how they can use it.  About repository languages  The files and directories within a repository determine the languages that make up the repository. You can view a repository's languages to get a quick overview of the repository.  Licensing a repository  Public repositories on GitHub are often used to share open source software. For your repository to truly be open source, you'll need to license it so that others are free to use, change, and distribute the software.  Creating an issues-only repository  GitHub does not provide issues-only access permissions, but you can accomplish this using a second repository which contains only the issues.  Limits for viewing content and diffs in a repository  Certain types of resources can be quite large, requiring excessive processing on GitHub. Because of this, limits are set to ensure requests complete in a reasonable amount of time.  Duplicating a repository  To duplicate a repository without forking it, you can run a special clone command, then mirror-push to the new repository.",

      "body": "You can configure pull request merge options on GitHub to meet your workflow needs and preferences for managing Git history. You can enforce one type of merge method, such as commit squashing or rebasing, by only enabling the desired method for your repository. When you click the default Merge pull request option on a pull request on GitHub, all commits from the feature branch are added to the base branch in a merge commit. The pull request is merged using the --no-ff option. To merge pull requests, you must have write permissions in the repository.   Squashing your merge commits When you select the Squash and merge option on a pull request on GitHub, the pull request's commits are squashed into a single commit. Instead of seeing all of a contributor's individual commits from a topic branch, the commits are combined into one commit and merged into the default branch. Pull requests with squashed commits are merged using the fast-forward option. To squash and merge pull requests, you must have write permissions in the repository, and the repository must allow squash merging.  You can use squash and merge to create a more streamlined Git history in your repository. Work-in-progress commits are helpful when working on a feature branch, but they aren’t necessarily important to retain in the Git history. If you squash these commits into one commit while merging to the default branch, you can retain the original changes with a clear Git history. Before enabling squashing commits, consider these disadvantages:  You lose information about when specific changes were originally made and who authored the squashed commits. Some Git commands that use the \"SHA\" or \"hash\" ID may be harder to use since the SHA ID for the original commits is lost. For example, using git rerere may not be as effective.  For more information, see \"Configuring commit squashing for pull requests.\"  Rebasing and merging your commits When you select the Rebase and merge option on a pull request on GitHub, all commits from the topic branch (or head branch) are added onto the base branch individually without a merge commit. Pull requests with rebased commits are merged using the fast-forward option. To rebase and merge pull requests, you must have write permissions in the repository, and the repository must allow rebase merging. The rebase and merge behavior on GitHub deviates slightly from git rebase. Rebase and merge on GitHub will always update the committer information and create new commit SHAs, whereas git rebase outside of GitHub does not change the committer information when the rebase happens on top of an ancestor commit. For more information about git rebase, see the \"Git rebase\" chapter from the Pro Git book. For a visual representation of git rebase, see The \"Git Branching - Rebasing\" chapter from the Pro Git book. Before enabling commit rebasing, consider these disadvantages:  Repository contributors may have to rebase on the command line, resolve any conflicts, and force push their changes to the pull request's topic branch (or remote head branch) before they can use the rebase and merge option on GitHub. Force pushing must be done carefully so contributors don't overwrite work that others have based their work on. To learn more about when the Rebase and merge option is disabled on GitHub and the workflow to re-enable it, see \"About pull request merges.\"  For more information, see \"Configuring commit rebasing for pull requests.\"",

They can help confirm that you have configured your custom domain correctly with their services.   Warning:  Unless your DNS provider supports CNAME flattening, don't create a CNAME record for your custom apex domain! Doing so may cause issues with other services, such as email, on that domain. We highly recommend adding your custom domain to your GitHub Pages site's repository before configuring your domain name with your DNS provider. For more information, see \"Adding or removing a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site.\"   For more information on apex domains, see \"About supported custom domains.\" To determine which type of DNS record to configure with your DNS provider, check if your DNS provider supports ALIAS or ANAME records. We recommend configuring your apex domain with an ALIAS or ANAME record when possible because they are easier to set up and require less updating since they point your site to another domain name instead of an IP address. A records point your site to one or more IP address and require updating when the IP address changes.  Note: Some DNS providers support configuring apex domains with an ALIAS or ANAME record, but there is no industry standard for these. Only DNS Made Easy currently supports ANAME records and DNSimple is one of the few DNS providers that support ALIAS records.   If your DNS provider does support ALIAS or ANAME records, then see configuring an ALIAS or ANAME record with your DNS provider. If your DNS provider does not support ALIAS or ANAME records, then see configuring A records with your DNS provider   Configuring an ALIAS or ANAME record with your DNS provider  Confirm that you have added a custom domain to your GitHub Pages site. Contact your DNS provider for detailed instructions on how to set up ALIAS or ANAME records.  Follow your DNS provider's instructions to create an ALIAS or ANAME record that points your apex domain to the GitHub Pages server at your default pages domain. Your DNS changes can take over a full day to update and the wait varies among DNS providers.  Note: Your default GitHub Pages domain is determined by the type of pages site you have. For examples, see this domain chart.    To confirm that your DNS record is set up correctly, use the dig command with your custom domain. Using a custom domain as an example:  $ dig example.com +noall +answer &gt; example.com. 3600 IN A 199.27.XX.XXX  When you use the dig command with your GitHub Pages default domain, your domain should resolve or point to the same IP address. For example:  $ dig YOUR-USERNAME.github.io +noall +answer &gt; YOUR-USERNAME.github.io 3600 IN A 199.27.XX.XXX     Configuring A records with your DNS provider  Confirm that you have added a custom domain to your GitHub Pages site. Contact your DNS provider for detailed instructions on how to set up A records.  Follow your DNS provider's instructions to create two A records that point your custom domain to the following IP addresses:   192.30.252.153  192.30.252.154    Tip: Your DNS changes can take over a full day to update and the wait varies among DNS providers.

GitHub’s Developer Program (the “Program”) helps us to connect with you, share information with you, and support your creative efforts better than ever before. The special relationship between GitHub and the developer community that the Program creates requires a special set of terms. Welcome to the Registered Developer Agreement (“Agreement”). This Agreement is a legal agreement between you (“you”) and GitHub, Inc. (“GitHub”, “we”, or “us”). Be sure to read this Agreement carefully - it governs your participation in the Program, and we’re only willing to let you participate in the Program if you accept all the terms of this Agreement. By clicking “I Agree” below, or by participating in the Program in any way – for example, by accessing information about GitHub products or features that aren’t yet available to the general public – you’re agreeing to be bound by all the terms of this Agreement. IF YOU’RE ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE LEGAL AUTHORITY TO BIND THE ENTITY TO THIS AGREEMENT, IN WHICH CASE \"YOU\" WILL MEAN THE ENTITY YOU REPRESENT. IF YOU DON’T HAVE SUCH AUTHORITY, OR IF YOU DON’T AGREE WITH THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU MUST SELECT THE \"CANCEL\" BUTTON AND YOU MAY NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM. IF YOU’RE A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT THE PERSON CLICKING “I AGREE” HAS THE AUTHORITY TO BIND YOU TO THIS AGREEMENT.  GitHub.com’s Terms of Use Will Apply You need to have an account on GitHub.com in order to participate in the Program. By clicking “I Agree” at the bottom of this Agreement, you are also agreeing to be bound by the GitHub.com Terms of Service (the “TOS”). In the event of a direct conflict between this Agreement and theTOS, this Agreement will control; otherwise, both agreements will apply to you concurrently. Program Terms We post the Program’s benefits and guidelines (the “Program Overview”). As you might expect, the Program Overview will change from time to time. These changes will apply to you as a participant in the Program, so we encourage you to periodically review the Program Overview to keep apprised of any changes. For a variety of reasons, we might need to change, suspend, or discontinue the Program, or some of the benefits we offer. You agree that we can do those things without liability to you, except as specified in Section 8. API License So long as you remain compliant with the TOS, this Agreement, and the Program Terms, we grant You a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable license during the term of this Agreement to access and use our API (as defined in the TOS) solely for the purpose of developing, demonstrating, testing and supporting interoperability and integrations between your products and services and our products and services.  You promise not to do bad things with our API. Among other things, this means you won’t – and won’t allow or permit others to – modify, publish, sell, lease, license, distribute, or sublicense our API; decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to derive source code from our API; reproduce, modify or create derivative works from our API; use our API to provide service bureau, application hosting, or processing services to third parties; incorporate or otherwise combine or integrate our API with any of your products or services; or use our API to engage in, support, or enable any kind of illegal activity.  We reserve the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, your access to the API (or any part of it) with or without notice. It’s your sole responsibility to ensure that your use of the API is compatible with the then-current API. Other than the rights we expressly give you in this Agreement or the TOS, We don’t grant you any rights or licenses to our API, or to any other GitHub products or services. Your Products, Services, and Integrations  Your products, services, and integrations (collectively, your “Products”) are your responsibility. That means that you’re solely responsible for developing, operating, and maintaining all aspects of your Products; ensuring that all materials used with or in your Products are legal in all the jurisdictions where your Products are used, and don’t promote illegal activities; obtaining any rights or licenses necessary to use and/or distribute any third-party software that you use, include, integrate, or distribute with your Products; and providing your end user customers with the same high-quality technical support for your Products when they operate in conjunction with our API or any other of our products and services as you do when they operate on their own. Marketing and Publicity  Marketing and publicizing your integrations with GitHub is valuable to both of us. We want to be sure that happens in the right way, so we’ve included some language here to help clarify some basic “dos” and “don’ts”.  You agree that you won’t make any representations, warranties, guarantees or endorsements to anyone on behalf of GitHub (including, among other things, any GitHub products or services). Unless we specifically say it’s okay in the Program Terms, you promise not to state or imply that we have developed, endorsed, reviewed or otherwise approved of any of your Products.  If you decide to promote or publicize any of our products or services in connection with your Products, you’ll need to make sure that you abide by the terms of this Agreement, the Program Terms, the TOS, our trademark policy, and any other applicable GitHub policies. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the TOS, and during the term of this Agreement, we grant you a limited, revocable, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use our trademarks, service marks, and logos (collectively, the “GitHub Marks”) in accordance with our trademark policy and as specified in the Program Terms, solely for the purpose of publicizing your membership in the Program.  We want to tell the world about you, and your participation in the Program. To help us do that, you grant us a limited, revocable, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use your trademarks, service marks, and logos (collectively, the “Partner Marks”) in our marketing materials, solely for the purpose of promoting the Program and publicizing your participation in it.  Except as set forth in this Agreement and the TOS, nothing in this Agreement will be deemed to grant to one party any right, title or interest in or to the other party’s Marks. You agree not to, whether during or after the term of this Agreement: (i) challenge or assist others in challenging the GitHub Marks, or our registration or enforcement of the GitHub Marks; (ii) attempt to adopt, use, apply for, or register any trademark, service mark, logo, URL, Internet domain name, or symbol that is confusingly similar to the GitHub Marks; or (iii) make any negative, false, or disparaging statements (whether written or oral) to any third-party about us, our products, or our services. Confidentiality; Pre-Release Materials  As a registered developer in the Program, you may get access to special information not available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.  You agree that any non-public information we give you, or that you may have access to as part of the Program, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for your authorized purposes as a participant in the Program (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should take reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third-party other than your employees and contractors, and then only to the extent that: (i) they need to know the Confidential Information for the Purpose; (ii) you make them aware of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information; (iii) you remain responsible for the acts and omissions of such employees and contractors; and (iv) we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure.  You understand that unauthorized disclosure or use of our Confidential Information could cause us irreparable harm, and significant injury that may be difficult for us to quantify. Accordingly, you agree that we’ll have the right to seek immediate injunctive relief to make sure you comply with this Agreement, in addition to any other rights and remedies we may have. If you are required by law, regulation or a valid binding order of a court of competent jurisdiction to disclose our Confidential Information, you may do so, but only if you notify us before you do, and do your best to limit such disclosure and to seek confidential, protective treatment of such information.  The obligations in this Section 6 won’t apply to information that you can prove: (i) was generally available to the public before we disclosed it to you; (ii) became generally available to the public after we disclosed it to you, through no action or inaction on your part, or on the part of your employees or contractors; (iii) you knew about before we disclosed it to you; (iv) was disclosed to you by a third-party, who didn’t have any confidentiality obligations with respect to it; (v) you independently developed without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third-party; or (vi) we gave you permission to disclose, in a writing signed by one of our authorized representatives.  If We give you any pre-release software or related documentation or materials, which may include videos or other forms of content (“Pre-Release Materials”), then subject to your compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the TOS, we hereby grant you a nonexclusive, nontransferable, revocable right and license to use the Pre-Release Materials solely to support your testing and/or development of products or services that are designed to operate in combination with the systems or programs for which the Pre-Release Materials are designed. If the Pre-Release Materials are accompanied by a separate license agreement, you agree that the separate license agreement (in addition to any more restrictive provisions contained in this Agreement or the TOS) will apply. You agree not to decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, or otherwise reduce the Pre-Release Materials to a human-perceivable form, and you promise not to modify, network, rent, lease, transmit, sell, or loan the Pre-Release Materials, in whole or in part. You understand that we’re under no obligation to provide any Pre-Release Materials to you, to provide you with updates, enhancements, or corrections to the Pre-Release Materials, or to notify you of changes that we make to our products and services, now or in the future. Fees and Payment  There may be fees associated with participating in the Program. We’ll tell you what those fees are in the Program Terms, as we update them from time to time (the “Program Fees”). If you gave us your payment information before, you agree that we can charge the same credit card or PayPal account as part of this Agreement. Otherwise, you’ll need to give us a valid payment account, and other supporting information. Except as otherwise expressly provided in Section 8, any payments you make to us for the Program are non-refundable.You give us permission to automatically charge your payment account on the anniversary of your first payment date to cover all of the coming year’s Program Fees, unless you terminate this Agreement first according to Section 8. All fees are due in U.S. Dollars, and are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities (you’re responsible for all of those, except for taxes based on our income). Term and Termination  This Agreement begins on the date you click “Agree”, and continues for a period of one (1) year. This Agreement will automatically renew for successive one-year terms unless either party gives written notice at least thirty (30) days before the current term expires that it wants to terminate, or one of us terminates it earlier in accordance with this Section 8.  Either you or GitHub may terminate this Agreement for any reason, without cause, upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the other. If we terminate this Agreement or discontinue your access to the Program for any reason other than your breach of this Agreement, the Program Terms, or the TOS, we will, as your sole remedy and our sole obligation for such termination, refund you the pro rata portion of the Program Fees you paid us for the current term of this Agreement. This Agreement will terminate immediately, without the requirement of notice, if you breach any term of this Agreement, the Program Terms, or the TOS.  The rights and obligations in Sections 1, 2, 3 (second and third paragraphs), 4, 5 (second and last paragraphs), 6, 7, and 9 through 21 of this Agreement will survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement all of the rights and licenses we granted you in this Agreement will immediately cease to exist, you will return (or, at our request, destroy) all of our Confidential Information and any copies (including electronic copies) which are in your possession or control, and you will certify in writing that you’ve complied with these requirements. Warranties and Disclaimers  You warrant to us that you: (i) have the authority to execute this Agreement and to perform its obligations; (ii) will conduct business in a manner that reflects favorably at all times on GitHub’s products and services and our good name, goodwill and reputation; (iii) will make no false or misleading statements or representations regarding GitHub or our products and services; (iv) will not take on any obligation or responsibility, or make any representation, warranty, guarantee or endorsement to anyone on our behalf (including, without limitation, any of our products or services); and (v) will not state or imply that We have developed, endorsed, reviewed or otherwise approved of any of your Products.  THE PROGRAM, THE API AND ANY CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION WE GIVE YOU (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE PRE-RELEASE MATERIALS) ARE PROVIDED “AS IS”, AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. WE SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT ANY SERVICES OR PRODUCTS WE MAKE AVAILABLE TO YOU WILL MEET YOUR OR YOUR END USERS’ REQUIREMENTS.

Every GitHub repository comes equipped with a section for hosting documentation, called a wiki.  GitHub Wikis are a place in your repository where you can share long-form content about your project, such as how to use it, how it's been designed, manifestos on its core principles, and so on. Whereas a README is intended to quickly orient readers as to what your project can do, wikis can be used to provide additional documentation. With wikis, you can write content just like everywhere else on GitHub. We use our open-source Markup library to convert different formats into HTML, so you can choose to write in Markdown, RST, Textile, or any other supported format when you craft wiki pages. Wikis can be edited directly on GitHub, or you can work with a text editor offline and simply push your changes. Wikis are collaborative by design. By default, only collaborators on your repository can make changes to wikis, but you can configure this to be enabled for all users on public repositories.

      "category_url": "/categories/authenticating-to-github",
      "url": "/articles/about-anonymized-image-urls",
      "body": "To host your images, GitHub uses the open-source project Camo. Camo generates an anonymous URL proxy for each image that starts with https://camo.githubusercontent.com/ and hides your browser details and related information from other users. Anyone who receives your anonymized image URL, directly or indirectly, may view your image. To keep sensitive images private, restrict them to a private network or a server that requires authentication instead of using Camo.  Troubleshooting issues with Camo In rare circumstances, images that are processed through Camo might not appear on GitHub. Here are some steps you can take to determine where the problem lies.     Windows users will either need to use the Git Powershell (which is installed alongside GitHub Desktop) or download curl for Windows.        An image is not showing up If an image is showing up in your browser but not on GitHub, you can try requesting the image locally.  Open TerminalTerminalGit Bash.  Request the image using curl.  curl -i https://www.my-server.com/images/some-image.png -o /dev/null HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Fri, 06 Jun 2014 07:27:43 GMT Expires: Sun, 06 Jul 2014 07:27:43 GMT Content-Type: image/x-png Server: Google Frontend Content-Length: 6507   Check the value of Content-Type. In this case, it's image/x-png. Check that content type against the list of types supported by Camo.  If your content type is not supported by Camo, you can try several actions:  If you own the server that's hosting the image, modify it so that it returns a correct content type for images. If you're using an external service for hosting images, contact support for that service. Make a pull request to Camo to add your content type to the list.   An image that changed recently is not updating If you changed an image recently and it's showing up in your browser but not GitHub, you can try resetting the cache of the image.  Open TerminalTerminalGit Bash.  Request the image using curl.  curl -i https://www.my-server.com/images/some-image.png -o /dev/null HTTP/1.1 200 OK Expires: Fri, 01 Jan 1984 00:00:00 GMT Content-Type: image/png Content-Length: 2339 Server: Jetty(8.y.z-SNAPSHOT)    Check the value of Cache-Control. In this example, there's no Cache-Control. In that case:  If you own the server that's hosting the image, modify it so that it returns a Cache-Control of no-cache for images.  If you're using an external service for hosting images, contact support for that service. If Cache-Control is set to no-cache, please contact GitHub Support to resolve the problem.    Removing an image from Camo's cache Purging the cache forces every GitHub user to re-request the image, so you should use it very sparingly and only in the event that the above steps did not work.  Open TerminalTerminalGit Bash.  Purge the image using curl -X PURGE on the Camo URL.  curl -X PURGE https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4d04abe0044d94fefcf9af2133223.... {\"status\": \"ok\", \"id\": \"216-8675309-1008701\"}     Viewing images on private networks If an image is being served from a private network or from a server that requires authentication, it can't be viewed by GitHub. In fact, it can't be viewed by any user without asking them to log into the server. To fix this, please move the image to a service that is publicly available.

Note: If your commits are linked to another user, that does not mean the user can access your repository. A user can only access a repository you own if you add them as a collaborator or add them to a team that has access to the repository.   Commits are linked to another user If your commits are linked to another user, that means the user has added the email address in your local Git configuration settings to their GitHub account. In this case, you can change the email in your local Git configuration settings and add the new email address to your GitHub account to link future commits to your account.  To change the email address in your local Git configuration, follow the steps in \"Setting your email in Git\". If you work on multiple machines, you will need to change this setting on each one. Add the email address from step 2 to your account settings by following the steps in \"Adding an email address to your GitHub account\".

For information on the differences between these URLs, see \"Which remote URL should I use?\"  Creating remotes You can use the git remote add command to match a remote URL with a name.

Miscellaneous Please see this section for legal details including our choice of law.     The GitHub Corporate Terms of Service Effective date: March 1, 2017  A. Definitions Short version: We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.  The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Corporate Terms of Service” or the \"Terms\") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at github.com/site/privacy) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at help.github.com/categories/site-policy. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at github.com, and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as education.github.com and pages.github.com. These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as CodeConf.com and product websites, such as atom.io. Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service. \"Customer\", “You,” and “Your” refer to the company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the account; or that directs the use of the account in the performance of its functions. Special terms may apply for business or government accounts (See Section B(6): Additional Terms). \"User\" refers to the individual who has visited or is using the Website or Service on your behalf; that accesses or uses any part of the account on your behalf; or that directs the use of the account in the performance of their functions on your behalf. A User must be at least 13 years of age. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees. A \"Corporate Account\" refers to any account created by a User on behalf of an entity, such as a company, non-profit organization, or group. A Corporate Account may include a Business plan, a Team plan, or a Developer plan. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. \"Content\" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. “Paid Content” is Content only available to Users who are participating in a payment plan, including private repositories.   B. Account Terms Short version: A human must create your account; the creator and Users of your account must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free account. You alone are responsible for your account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your account. You are responsible for keeping your account secure.  1. Required Information You must provide a valid email address and your company’s name in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you upgrade to a paid account. Please see the section on Payment for information about paid accounts.  2. Corporate Terms Applicability The Corporate Terms of Service Agreement applies only if you are entering into an agreement with GitHub on behalf of an entity, such as a company, non-profit organization, or group. If you are entering into an agreement with GitHub as an individual, you should not sign this Agreement; please use the GitHub Terms of Service Agreement. To the extent these terms conflict with any other terms you've accepted for use of GitHub.com, these terms will govern with respect to any work you do on GitHub on behalf of Customer. If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of an entity, you represent that you are authorized to enter into the Agreement and bind the entity to these Terms.  3. Corporate Account Association If you would like to associate your Corporate Account with a company name, we will do our best to confirm that association based on the information you provide to us. The more information you provide, the better able we will be to confirm that association. Information that helps us confirm a company's association with an account includes: the name of the business included at the time of acceptance of these Terms, the payment information, and the email addresses associated with the account. In the event that you do not provide sufficient information for us to confirm your company's association with the account, association will be determined by the email addresses and security settings within your account settings.  4. Corporate Account Requirements You must create an individual account before you can create a Corporate Account. We have a few simple rules for individual accounts on GitHub:  You must be a human to create an account. Accounts registered by \"bots\" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:  A machine account is an account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free personal account.   One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine). You may not create an account for the use of any User under the age of 13. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will terminate that User’s account immediately. If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws. Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid organization account may create separate logins for as many users as its subscription allows. Overall, the number of Users must not exceed the number of accounts you've ordered from us.   5. User Account Security You are responsible for keeping your account secure while using GitHub. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your account's security, but the content of your account and its security are up to you.  You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under its account (even when content is posted by others who have accounts under your account). You are responsible for maintaining the security of its account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation. You will promptly notify GitHub if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your account, including any unauthorized use of your password or account.   6. Additional Terms In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you. If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service applies to you, and you agree to its provisions. If you have signed up for a Business Plan, the Business Plan Addendum applies to you, and you agree to its provisions. If you are an owner or administrator of an Organization on GitHub, additional terms may govern your relationship with us and supersede this Agreement.  C. Acceptable Use Short version: GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow this Acceptable Use Policy, which includes some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.  1. Compliance with Laws and Regulations Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your and your Users' use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.  2. Content Restrictions You agree that under no circumstances will you or your Users upload, post, host, or transmit any content that:  is unlawful or promotes unlawful activities; is or contains sexually obscene content; is libelous, defamatory, or fraudulent; is discriminatory or abusive toward any individual or group; contains or installs any active malware or exploits, or uses our platform for exploit delivery (such as part of a command and control system); or infringes on any proprietary right of any party, including patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, right of publicity, or other rights.   3. Conduct Restrictions While using GitHub, you agree that under no circumstances, will you or your Users:  harass, abuse, threaten, or incite violence towards any individual or group, including GitHub employees, officers, and agents, or other GitHub Users; use our servers for any form of excessive automated bulk activity (for example, spamming), or relay any other form of unsolicited advertising or solicitation through our servers, such as get-rich-quick schemes; attempt to disrupt or tamper with GitHub's servers in ways that could harm our Website or Service, to place undue burden on GitHub's servers through automated means, or to access GitHub's Service in ways that exceed your authorization (other than those authorized by the GitHub Bug Bounty program); impersonate any person or entity, including any of our employees or representatives, including through false association with GitHub, or by fraudulently misrepresenting your identity or site's purpose; or violate the privacy of any third party, such as by posting another person's personal information without consent.   4. Services Usage Limits You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the Service, use of the Service, or access to the Service without GitHub's express written permission.  5. Scraping Scraping refers to extracting data from our Website via an automated process, such as a bot or webcrawler. It does not refer to the collection of information through GitHub's API. Please see Section G for our API Terms. You may scrape the website for the following reasons:  Researchers may scrape public, non-personal information from GitHub for research purposes, only if any publications resulting from that research are open access. Archivists may scrape GitHub for public data for archival purposes.  You may not scrape GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards. All use of GitHub data gathered through scraping must comply with the GitHub Privacy Statement.  6. Privacy Misuse of GitHub Users' Personal Information is prohibited. Any person, entity, or service collecting data from GitHub must comply with the GitHub Privacy Statement, particularly in regards to the collection of our Users' Personal Information (as defined in the GitHub Privacy Statement). If you collect any GitHub User's Personal Information from GitHub, you agree that you will only use the Personal Information you gather for the purpose for which our User has authorized it. You agree that you will reasonably secure any Personal Information you have gathered from GitHub, and you will respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and \"do not contact\" requests from GitHub or GitHub Users.  7. Excessive Bandwidth Use If we determine your bandwidth usage to be significantly excessive in relation to other GitHub customers, we reserve the right to suspend your account or throttle your file hosting until you can reduce your bandwidth consumption.  8. User Protection You agree not to engage in activity that significantly harms our Users. We will resolve disputes in favor of protecting our Users as a whole.  D. User-Generated Content Short version: You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close accounts if we need to.  1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content You may create User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you or your Users post, upload, link to or otherwise makes available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.  2. Ownership of Content and Right to Post You retain ownership of and responsibility for Content you and your Users create. If you're posting anything you or your Users did not create yourselves and on your behalf, you agrees that you and your Users will only submit Content that you have the right to post, and you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you and your Users post.  3. GitHub May Remove Content We do not pre-screen User-Generated Content, but we have the right (though not the obligation) to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any GitHub terms or policies.  4. License Grant to Us Your Content belongs to you, and you are responsible for Content you post even if it does not belong to you. However, we need the legal right to do things like host it, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store and display your Content and make incidental copies as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service. That means you're giving us the right to do things like reproduce your content (so we can do things like copy it to our database and make backups); display it (so we can do things like show it to you and other users); modify it (so our server can do things like parse it into a search index); distribute it (so we can do things like share it with other users); and perform it (in case your content is something like music or video). This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell your Content or otherwise distribute it outside of our Service.  5. License Grant to Other Users Any Content you or your Users post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and \"fork\" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of your Content in repositories they control). If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to access your Content through the GitHub Service, and to use, display and perform your Content, and to reproduce your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality. You may grant further rights if you adopt a license.  6. Contributions Under Repository License Whenever you make a contribution to a repository containing notice of a license, you license your contribution under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license your contribution under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license your contributions under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supercede. Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand \"inbound=outbound\". We're just making it explicit.  7. Moral Rights You retain all moral rights to Content you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in this Section. To the extent such an agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub a nonexclusive, revocable, worldwide, royalty-free right to (1) use the Content without attribution strictly as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service; and (2) make reasonable adaptations of the Content as provided in this Section. We need these rights to allow basic functions like search to work.  8. Private Repositories Paid accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content. GitHub employees only access private repositories when access is required for security or maintenance or for support reasons, and then only with the consent of the repository owner. Because we respect your privacy in private repositories, you must respect the Terms of Service in everything you post to a private repository. If we have reason to believe the contents of a private repository are in violation of the law or of these Terms, we have the right to remove them.  E. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy. If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via our convenient DMCA form or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses. We will terminate the accounts of repeat infringers of this policy.  F. Intellectual Property Notice Short version: We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.  1. GitHub's Rights to Content GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, Javascript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from GitHub.  2. GitHub Trademarks and Logos If you’d like to use GitHub’s trademarks, you must follow all of our trademark guidelines, including those on our logos page: https://github.com/logos.  3. License to GitHub Policies This Agreement is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution license. You may use it freely under the terms of the Creative Commons license.  G. API Terms Short version: You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section G, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.  1. Limitation of Liability for API Use You understand and agree that GitHub is not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including but not limited to damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (even if GitHub has been advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting from your use of the API or third-party products that access data via the API.  2. No Abuse or Overuse of the API Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension. You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations. You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards. All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the GitHub Privacy Statement. GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.  3. GitHub May Terminate Your Use of the API We reserve the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, your access to the API or any part of it with or without notice.  H. Additional Terms for GitHub Pages Short version: The GitHub Pages hosting service is subject to certain rules, in addition to the rest of the Terms. Each GitHub account comes with access to the GitHub Pages static hosting service. This hosting service is intended to host static web pages for GitHub users. GitHub Pages are subject to some specific bandwidth and usage limits, and may not be appropriate for some high-bandwidth uses. Please see our GitHub Pages guidelines for more information. GitHub reserves the right at all times to reclaim any GitHub subdomain without liability.  I. Advertising on GitHub Short version: We do not generally prohibit use of GitHub for advertising. However, we expect our users to follow certain limitations, so GitHub does not become a spam haven. No one wants that.  1. GitHub Pages We offer Pages sites primarily as a showcase for personal and organizational projects. Some monetization efforts are permitted on Pages, such as donation buttons and crowdfunding links.  2. GitHub Repositories GitHub repositories are intended to host Content. You may include static images, links, and promotional text in the README documents associated with your repositories, but they must be related to the project you are hosting on GitHub. You may not advertise in other Users' repositories, such as by posting monetized or excessive bulk content in issues.  3. Spamming and Inappropriate Use of GitHub Advertising Content, like all Content, must not violate the law or these Terms of Use, for example through excessive bulk activity such as spamming. We reserve the right to remove any advertisements that, in our sole discretion, violate any GitHub terms or policies.  J. Payment Short version: You are responsible for any fees associated with your use of GitHub. We are responsible for communicating those fees to you clearly and accurately, and letting you know well in advance if those prices change.  1. Pricing Our pricing and payment terms are available at github.com/pricing. If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.  2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes  We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan. If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date. If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately. You may change your level of service at any time by choosing a plan option or going into your Billing settings. If you choose to downgrade your account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your account. Please see our section on Cancellation for information on getting a copy of that Content.   3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds  For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months or partial years of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months or years unused with an open account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.   4. Authorization By agreeing to these Terms, you are giving us permission to charge your on-file credit card, PayPal account, or other approved methods of payment for fees that you authorize for GitHub.  5. Responsibility for Payment You are responsible for all fees, including taxes, associated with your use of the Service. By using the Service, you agree to pay GitHub any charge incurred in connection with your use of the Service. If you dispute the matter, contact GitHub Support. You are responsible for providing us with a valid means of payment for paid accounts. Free accounts are not required to provide payment information.  K. Cancellation and Termination Short version: You may close your account at any time. If you do, we'll treat your information responsibly.  1. Account Cancellation It is your responsibility to properly cancel your account with GitHub. You can cancel your account at any time by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel accounts in response to an email or phone request.  2. Upon Cancellation We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information can not be recovered once your account is cancelled. We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked. Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing account contents after account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.  3. GitHub May Terminate GitHub has the right to suspend your access to all or any part of the Website at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. GitHub has the right to terminate your access to all or any part of the Website at any time, with or without cause, upon thirty (30) days advanced notice. If we do, we will make a reasonable effort to provide the affected account owner with a copy of their lawful, non-infringing account contents upon request.  4. Survival All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination will survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.  L. Communications with GitHub Short version: We use email and other electronic means to stay in touch with our users.  1. Electronic Communication Required For contractual purposes, you (1) consent to receive communications from us in an electronic form via the email address you have submitted or via the Service; and (2) agree that all Terms of Service, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that those communications would satisfy if they were on paper. This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.  2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing Communications made through email or GitHub Support's messaging system will not constitute legal notice to GitHub or any of its officers, employees, agents or representatives in any situation where notice to GitHub is required by contract or any law or regulation. Legal notice to GitHub must be in writing and served on GitHub's legal agent.  3. No Phone Support GitHub only offers support via email, in-Service communications, and electronic messages. We do not offer telephone support.  M. Disclaimer of Warranties Short version: We provide our service as is, and we make no promises or guarantees about this service. Please read this section carefully; you should understand what to expect. GitHub provides the Website and the Service “as is” and “as available,” without warranty of any kind. Without limiting this, we expressly disclaim all warranties, whether express, implied or statutory, regarding the Website and the Service including without limitation any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, security, accuracy and non-infringement. GitHub does not warrant that the Service will meet your requirements; that the Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free; that the information provided through the Service is accurate, reliable or correct; that any defects or errors will be corrected; that the Service will be available at any particular time or location; or that the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components. You assume full responsibility and risk of loss resulting from your downloading and/or use of files, information, content or other material obtained from the Service.  N. Limitation of Liability To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, each party's total cumulative liability to the other party or any third party under this Agreement from all causes of action and all theories of liability will be limited to and will not exceed the fees you've actually paid us during the 24 months preceding the claim giving rise to such liability. You understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however arising, that result from  the use, disclosure, or display of your User-Generated Content; your use or inability to use the Service; any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Service; the Service generally or the software or systems that make the Service available; unauthorized access to or alterations of your transmissions or data; statements or conduct of any third party on the Service; any other user interactions that you input or receive through your use of the Service; or any other matter relating to the Service.  Our liability is limited whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damages, and even if a remedy set forth in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose. We will have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond our reasonable control.  O. Release and Indemnification  1. Customer’s Indemnification You are responsible for your use of the service. If you harm someone else or get into a dispute with someone else, we will not be involved. Subject to the limitations above, you agree to indemnify us and us hold harmless from and against any and all third party claims and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement, provided that GitHub (a) promptly gives Customer written Notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding.; (b) gives Customer sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit, or proceeding (provided that Customer may not settle any claim, demand, suit, or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub of all liability); and (c) provides to Customer all reasonable assistance, at Customer’s expense. If you have a dispute with one or more Users, you agree to release GitHub from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes, provided that GitHub (i) promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (ii) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub of all liability); and (iii) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.  2. GitHub’s Indemnification We’ll defend or settle, at our option and expense, any third-party claim brought against you to the extent that it’s based on an allegation that GitHub’s service infringes a copyright or misappropriates a trade secret of any third party (each, a “Claim”), and, subject to Section N, above, Limitation of Liability, we’ll pay all damages and costs (including reasonable legal fees) finally awarded by a court of final appeal attributable to such a Claim, provided that you notify us in writing of any such Claim as soon as reasonably practicable and allow us to control, and reasonably cooperate with us in the defense of, any such Claim and related settlement negotiations. You understand that we’ll have no obligation to indemnify you for any claim (1) if the total aggregate fees received by GitHub with respect to your subscription to the services in the 12 month period immediately preceding the claim is less than US $50,000; (2) if the services are modified by any party other than GitHub, but solely to the extent the alleged infringement is caused by such modification; (3) if the services are used in combination with any services, software, or equipment without prior written authorization by GitHub, but solely to the extent the alleged infringement is caused by such combination; (4) to unauthorized use of the services; (5) to any Claim arising as a result of (y) your Content (or circumstances covered by your indemnification obligations in this Section O (Release and Indemnification: Customer’s Indemnification)) or (z) any third-party deliverables or components contained with the services; or (6) if you settle or make any admissions with respect to a claim without GitHub’s prior written consent. If your use of the services is, or in our reasonable opinion is likely to be, subject to a Claim under this Section N, we may, at our sole option and at no charge to you (and in addition to our indemnity obligation to you in this Section O): (i) procure for you the right to continue using the services; (ii) replace or modify the services so that they are non-infringing and substantially equivalent in function to the original services; or (iii) if options (i) and (ii) above are not commercially practicable in our reasonable estimation, we can terminate these Terms of Service.  P. Changes to These Terms Short version: We want our users to be informed of important changes to our terms, but some changes aren't that important — we don't want to bother you every time we fix a typo. So while we may modify this agreement at any time, we will notify users of any changes that affect your rights and give you time to adjust to them. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments. We will notify our Users of material changes to this Agreement, such as price changes, at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our Website. For non-material modifications, your continued use of the Website constitutes agreement to our revisions of these Terms of Service. We reserve the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Website (or any part of it) with or without notice.  Q. Miscellaneous  1. Governing Law Except to the extent applicable law provides otherwise, this Agreement between you and GitHub and any access to or use of the Website or the Service are governed by the federal laws of the United States of America and the laws of the State of California, without regard to conflict of law provisions. You and GitHub agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts located in the City and County of San Francisco, California.  2. Non-Assignability GitHub may assign or delegate these Terms of Service and/or the GitHub Privacy Statement, in whole or in part, to any person or entity at any time with or without your consent, including the license grant in Section D.4. Except in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of your business or assets, subject to Notice to GitHub, you may not assign or delegate any rights or obligations under the Terms of Service or Privacy Statement without our prior written consent, and any unauthorized assignment and delegation by you is void.  3. Section Headings and Summaries Throughout this Agreement, each section includes titles and brief summaries of the following terms and conditions. These section titles and brief summaries are not legally binding.  4. Severability, No Waiver, and Survival If any part of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion of the Agreement will be construed to reflect the parties’ original intent. The remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. Any failure on the part of GitHub to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not be considered a waiver of our right to enforce such provision. Our rights under this Agreement will survive any termination of this Agreement.  5. Complete Agreement These Terms of Service, together with the GitHub Privacy Statement, represent the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between you and us. This Agreement supersedes any proposal or prior agreement oral or written, and any other communications between you and GitHub relating to the subject matter of these terms.  6.

If you are transferring a private repository, the new repository owner must have a paid plan. When a repository is transferred between two user accounts, the original repository owner and collaborators are automatically added as collaborators to the new repository. When a repository is transferred between two user accounts, issue assignments are left intact.  Transferring to an organization Users must have admin or owner permissions within the receiving organization before they can transfer a repository that they individually own. Your organization's default membership privileges will apply to the transferred repository. For example, if your default repository permission settings allow organization members read/write access, then all organization members can clone, pull, and push all repositories, including transferred repositories. See \"Permission Levels for an Organization\" for more information. If you transfer a repository from a user account to an organization, issues assigned to members in the organization remain intact. All other issue assignees are cleared. Only owners in the organization are allowed to create new issue assignments.  Transferring a repository to another user account or to an organization  On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository. Under your repository name, click  Settings.  Click Transfer.

This setting is deprecated as has been removed from the latest version of Jekyll. To ensure your site continues to build as expected, remove the option from your site's configuration and update any post or page permalinks to be absolute to the site root, not the parent folder.   Understanding relative and absolute permalinks Permalinks are permanent URLs that reference a particular post or page on your GitHub Pages site.   Absolute permalinks are URLs that begin with the root of the site.  Relative permalinks are modified URLs that begin with parent folder (the folder containing the referenced webpage) instead of the root of the site.  For more information, see Jekyll's official documentation on permalinks.  Troubleshooting relative permalink errors GitHub Pages and Jekyll no longer support relative permalinks. You must remove the relative_permalinks configuration option from your GitHub Pages site's _config.yml file and reformat any relative permalinks in your site to absolute permalinks.

      "body": "Jekyll themes allow you to install a different design for your GitHub Pages site without editing or copying CSS files. Jekyll themes package the files you need to change your site design, including files stored in your assets folder, such as SCSS, SASS, images, CoffeeScript.  Note: Not all Jekyll themes are supported. For a list of Jekyll themes that are supported by GitHub Pages, see https://pages.github.com/themes.  You can override a Jekyll theme's defaults with your site's content in these folders:  _layouts _includes _sass assets  For more information about the Jekyll theme files you can override, see your theme's README or other documentation in your theme's source repository. Once your Jekyll theme has been added in your site's _config.yml file, and assuming the theme is supported by GitHub Pages, your site will build with the requested theme.  Adding a Jekyll theme to your site  Adding your theme in your site's _config.yml file on GitHub  On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository. In your repository, browse to _config.yml. In the upper-right corner of the file view, click  to open the file editor.

Below the commit message fields, decide whether to add your commit to the current branch or to a new branch. If your current branch is master, you should choose to create a new branch for your commit and then create a pull request.  Click Propose file change.  If you created a pull request, merge your pull request into your GitHub Pages publishing branch, which is usually master and sometimes gh-pages.  Your site should now publish with the new theme you added.  Previewing your Jekyll theme locally If you haven't already, add your Jekyll theme to your site. You can preview the theme locally by following the steps detailed in the sections below.  Note: Before attempting to preview your Jekyll theme locally, ensure the following:  Have a local copy of your remote GitHub Pages site repository on your computer. If you don't have a local copy of your site repository, see \"Cloning a repository.\" If you don't have a remote GitHub Pages site repository on GitHub yet you can use someone else's open source site repository as a starting template and fork it. Have Bundler installed.    Adding your theme as a Gem to your Gemfile   Note: If you're using the web-only interface to edit, you don't need to add your theme to the site's Gemfile, if one exists.   On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository. In your repository, browse to Gemfile. In the upper-right corner of the file view, click  to open the file editor.  Add a new line to your Gemfile with the theme name in quotations:   Tip: You can add multiple Jekyll themes to your Gemfile but to activiate a theme, only one theme can be added to your _config.yml file.   At the bottom of the page, type a short, meaningful commit message that describes the change you made to the file.  Below the commit message fields, decide whether to add your commit to the current branch or to a new branch. If your current branch is master, you should choose to create a new branch for your commit and then create a pull request.  Click Propose file change.  If you created a pull request, merge your pull request into your GitHub Pages publishing branch, which is usually master and sometimes gh-pages. For more information on which branch to publish your site with, see \"User, Organization, and Project Pages.\"   Installing your theme using Bundler  Open TerminalTerminalGit Bash.

Troubleshooting _config.yml syntax errors  Tip: We strongly recommend running Jekyll locally so you can easily debug and fix build errors before pushing to GitHub. To learn more about troubleshooting options, see \"Troubleshooting GitHub Pages builds.\"  Check your _config.yml file at the line referenced in the build failure email. Ensure that:  You are using spaces instead of tabs in the file. You have included a space after the \":\" for each key/value pair.  Correct example: timezone: Africa/Nairobi  Build fail example: timezone:Africa/Nairobi. You are only using UTF-8 characters. You quote any special characters.  Correct example: title: \"my awesome site: an adventure in parse errors\"  Build fail example: title: my awesome site: an adventure in parse errors   Use a YAML linter, such as http://codebeautify.org/yaml-validator, to validate your YAML code. If you run into parse errors with your _config.yml file, try copying and pasting the contents of the file into such a tool for more details. Once you've fixed any syntax errors in your _config.yml file, you will need to commit your changes and push to your GitHub Pages repository again to trigger another build on our servers.  Fixing highlighting errors If you attempt to use a syntax highlighter other than Rouge on your GitHub Pages site with Jekyll, you'll receive a page build warning. GitHub Pages does not support other highlighters and will automatically use the default Rouge. For more information, see \"Using syntax highlighting on GitHub Pages.\" To fix page build warnings, you must change your highlighter value to rouge in your _config.yml file.  On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository. In your repository, browse to _config.yml. In the upper right corner of the file view, click  to open the file editor.   Find the line that starts with highlighter: and change the value to rouge.  At the bottom of the page, type a short, meaningful commit message that describes the change you made to the file.  Below the commit message fields, decide whether to add your commit to the current branch or to a new branch.

Viewing differences You can visually compare images in three different modes: 2-up, swipe, and onion skin.  2-up 2-up is the default mode; it gives you a quick glimpse of both images. In addition, if the image has changed size between versions, the actual dimension change is displayed. This should make it very apparent when things are resized, such as when assets are upgraded to higher resolutions.   Swipe Swipe lets you view portions of your image side by side. Not sure if colors shifted between different versions? Drag the swipe slider over the area in question and compare the pixels for yourself.

      "body": " If you're familiar with command-line Git, it's straightforward to manually create a Project Pages site.   Make a fresh clone To set up a Project Pages site, you need to create a new \"orphan\" branch (a branch that has no common history with an existing branch) in your repository. The safest way to do this is to start with a fresh clone:  git clone https://github.com/user/repository.git # Clone our repository Cloning into 'repository'... remote: Counting objects: 2791, done. remote: Compressing objects: 100% (1225/1225), done. remote: Total 2791 (delta 1722), reused 2513 (delta 1493) Receiving objects: 100% (2791/2791), 3.77 MiB | 969 KiB/s, done. Resolving deltas: 100% (1722/1722), done.   Create a master branch Once you have a clean repository, you'll need to create a new master branch unless your cloned repository already has a master branch.  Tip: You can also create a gh-pages branch for your Project Pages site instead. To learn more about your options, including the option to publish your Project Page from a /docs folder on your master branch, see \"User, Organization, and Project Pages.\"    Switch directories into your new cloned repository:  cd repository    Check if your repository already has a master branch:  git branch # shows a list of branches for your repository * branch-name * branch-name    If you don't already have a master branch in your repository, create a new master branch:  git checkout --orphan master # Creates a master branch, without any parents (it's an orphan!) Switched to a new branch 'master'   Tip: If you just created the master branch, it won't appear in your list of branches when you use the git branch command until you make your first commit.     Remove all files to create an empty working directory Once you have a master branch, you'll need to remove all content from the working directory and index:  git rm -rf . # Remove all files from the old working tree rm '.gitignore'   Add content and push  In order to trigger a build when you push to your Page's repository, you must first verify your email address.  Now you have an empty working directory. You can create some content in this branch and push it to GitHub. For example:  echo \"My Page\" &gt; index.html git add index.html git commit -a -m \"First pages commit\" git push origin master  Your GitHub Pages site should now be available. You'll receive an email if your build is unsuccessful.  Load your new GitHub Pages site After your push to the master branch, your Project Pages site will be available at 'http(s)://&lt;username&gt;.github.io/&lt;projectname&gt;' . Note that Pages are always publicly accessible when published, even if their repository is private.

      "body": "With SSH keys, if someone gains access to your computer, they also gain access to every system that uses that key. To add an extra layer of security, you can add a passphrase to your SSH key. You can use ssh-agent to securely save your passphrase so you don't have to reenter it.  Adding or changing a passphrase You can change the passphrase for an existing private key without regenerating the keypair by typing the following command:  ssh-keygen -p # Start the SSH key creation process Enter file in which the key is (/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa): [Hit enter] Key has comment '/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa' Enter new passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type new passphrase] Enter same passphrase again: [One more time for luck] Your identification has been saved with the new passphrase.  If your key already has a passphrase, you will be prompted to enter it before you can change to a new passphrase.   Auto-launching ssh-agent on Git for Windows If you're using Git Shell that's installed with GitHub Desktop, you don't need to follow these steps. GitHub Desktop automatically launches ssh-agent for you. Otherwise, follow these steps to run ssh-agent automatically when you open bash or Git shell. Copy the following lines and paste them into your ~/.profile or ~/.bashrc file in Git shell: env=~/.ssh/agent.env agent_load_env () { test -f \"$env\" &amp;&amp; . \"$env\" &gt;| /dev/null ; } agent_start () { (umask 077; ssh-agent &gt;| \"$env\") . \"$env\" &gt;| /dev/null ; } agent_load_env # agent_run_state: 0=agent running w/ key; 1=agent w/o key; 2= agent not running agent_run_state=$(ssh-add -l &gt;| /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1; echo $?) if [ ! \"$SSH_AUTH_SOCK\" ] || [ $agent_run_state = 2 ]; then agent_start ssh-add elif [ \"$SSH_AUTH_SOCK\" ] &amp;&amp; [ $agent_run_state = 1 ]; then ssh-add fi unset env  If your private key is not stored in one of the default locations (~/.ssh/id_rsa or ~/.ssh/id_dsa), you'll need to tell your SSH authentication agent where to find it. To add your key to ssh-agent, type ssh-add ~/path/to/my_key. For more information, see \"Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent\"  Tip: If you want ssh-agent to forget your key after some time, you can configure it to do so by running ssh-add -t &lt;seconds&gt;.  Now, when you first run Git Bash, you are prompted for your passphrase:  Initializing new SSH agent... succeeded Enter passphrase for /c/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa: Identity added: /c/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa (/c/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa) Welcome to Git (version 1.6.0.2-preview20080923) &gt; Run 'git help git' to display the help index. Run 'git help ' to display help for specific commands.  The ssh-agent process will continue to run until you log out, shut down your computer, or kill the process.    Saving your passphrase in the keychain On OS X Leopard through OS X El Capitan, these default private key files are handled automatically:  .ssh/id_rsa .ssh/id_dsa .ssh/identity  The first time you use your key, you will be prompted to enter your passphrase. If you choose to save the passphrase with your keychain, you won't have to enter it again. Otherwise, you can store your passphrase in the keychain when you add your key to the ssh-agent.

      "body": "Below are a list of some Git and GitHub specific terms we use across our sites and documentation. If you see some Git-related terminology not listed here, you might find an explanation of it in Git Reference or our Git SCM book.  Blame The \"blame\" feature in Git describes the last modification to each line of a file, which generally displays the revision, author and time. This is helpful, for example, in tracking down when a feature was added, or which commit led to a particular bug.  Branch A branch is a parallel version of a repository. It is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or master branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the \"live\" version. When you've made the changes you want to make, you can merge your branch back into the master branch to publish your changes.  Clone A clone is a copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server somewhere, or the act of making that copy. With your clone you can edit the files in your preferred editor and use Git to keep track of your changes without having to be online. It is, however, connected to the remote version so that changes can be synced between the two. You can push your local changes to the remote to keep them synced when you're online.  Collaborator A collaborator is a person with read and write access to a repository who has been invited to contribute by the repository owner.  Commit A commit, or \"revision\", is an individual change to a file (or set of files). It's like when you save a file, except with Git, every time you save it creates a unique ID (a.k.a. the \"SHA\" or \"hash\") that allows you to keep record of what changes were made when and by who. Commits usually contain a commit message which is a brief description of what changes were made.  Contributor A contributor is someone who has contributed to a project by having a pull request merged but does not have collaborator access.  Diff A diff is the difference in changes between two commits, or saved changes. The diff will visually describe what was added or removed from a file since its last commit.  Fetch Fetching refers to getting the latest changes from an online repository (like GitHub.com) without merging them in. Once these changes are fetched you can compare them to your local branches (the code residing on your local machine).  Fork A fork is a personal copy of another user's repository that lives on your account. Forks allow you to freely make changes to a project without affecting the original. Forks remain attached to the original, allowing you to submit a pull request to the original's author to update with your changes. You can also keep your fork up to date by pulling in updates from the original.  Git Git is an open source program for tracking changes in text files. It was written by the author of the Linux operating system, and is the core technology that GitHub, the social and user interface, is built on top of.  Issue Issues are suggested improvements, tasks or questions related to the repository. Issues can be created by anyone (for public repositories), and are moderated by repository collaborators. Each issue contains its own discussion forum, can be labeled and assigned to a user.  Markdown Markdown is an incredibly simple semantic file format, not too dissimilar from .doc, .rtf and .txt. Markdown makes it easy for even those without a web-publishing background to write prose (including with links, lists, bullets, etc.) and have it displayed like a website. GitHub supports Markdown, and you can learn about the semantics.  Merge Merging takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and applies them into another. This often happens as a Pull Request (which can be thought of as a request to merge), or via the command line. A merge can be done automatically via a Pull Request via the GitHub.com web interface if there are no conflicting changes, or can always be done via the command line. For more information, see \"Merging a pull request.\"  Open Source Open source software is software that can be freely used, modified, and shared (in both modified and unmodified form) by anyone. Today the concept of \"open source\" is often extended beyond software, to represent a philosophy of collaboration in which working materials are made available online for anyone to fork, modify, discuss, and contribute to. For more information on open source, specifically how to create and grow an open source project, we've created Open Source Guides that will help you foster a healthy open source community.  Organizations Organizations are a group of two or more users that typically mirror real-world organizations. They are administered by users and can contain both repositories and teams.  Private Repository Private repositories are repositories that can only be viewed or contributed to by their creator and collaborators the creator specified.  Pull Pull refers to when you are fetching in changes and merging them. For instance, if someone has edited the remote file you're both working on, you'll want to pull in those changes to your local copy so that it's up to date.  Pull Request Pull requests are proposed changes to a repository submitted by a user and accepted or rejected by a repository's collaborators. Like issues, pull requests each have their own discussion forum. For more information, see \"About pull requests.\"  Push Pushing refers to sending your committed changes to a remote repository such as GitHub.com. For instance, if you change something locally, you'd want to then push those changes so that others may access them.  Remote This is the version of something that is hosted on a server, most likely GitHub.com. It can be connected to local clones so that changes can be synced.  Repository A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. They're easiest to imagine as a project's folder. A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.  SSH Key SSH keys are a way to identify yourself to an online server, using an encrypted message. It's as if your computer has its own unique password to another service. GitHub uses SSH keys to securely transfer information from GitHub.com to your computer.  Upstream When talking about a branch or a fork, the primary branch on the original repository is often referred to as the \"upstream\", since that is the main place that other changes will come in from. The branch/fork you are working on is then called the \"downstream\".  User Users are personal GitHub accounts. Each user has a personal profile, and can own multiple repositories, public or private. They can create or be invited to join organizations or collaborate on another user's repository.  See Also  The Official Git Glossary ",

      "category_url": "/categories/search",
      "url": "/articles/searching-code",
      "body": " To search for code, use the following search qualifiers in any combination.   Tips:  There's a list of search syntaxes you can add to any search qualifier to further improve your results. Use quotations around your multi-word search terms. For example, if you want to search for issues with the label \"In progress,\" you'd search for label:\"in progress\". Search is not case sensitive.    Note: You must be logged in to search for code across all public repositories.   Considerations for code search Due to the complexity of searching code, there are a few restrictions on how searches are performed:  Only the default branch is considered. In most cases, this will be the master branch. Only files smaller than 384 KB are searchable. Only repositories with fewer than 500,000 files are searchable. Logged in users can search all public repositories while anonymous searches must include a limit on org:, user: or repo:. You must always include at least one search term when searching source code. For example, searching for language:javascript is not valid, while amazing language:javascript is. At most, search results can show two fragments from the same file, but there may be more results within the file. You can't use the following wildcard characters as part of your search query: . , : ; / \\ ` ' \" = * ! ? # $ &amp; + ^ | ~ &lt; &gt; ( ) { } [ ]. The search will simply ignore these symbols.   Scope the search fields The in qualifier limits what fields are searched. With this qualifier, you can restrict your search to the source code, the file path, or both. Without the qualifier, only the file contents are searched.  octocat in:file Matches code where \"octocat\" appears in the file contents. octocat in:path Matches code where \"octocat\" appears in the path name. octocat in:file,path Matches code where \"octocat\" appears in the file contents or the path name. display language:scss Matches code with the word \"display,\" that's marked as being SCSS. Integer Matches code with the word \"Integer\".   Search by language You can search for code based on what language it's written in. For example:  element language:xml size:100 Matches code with the word \"element\" that's marked as being XML and has exactly 100 bytes. user:mozilla language:markdown Matches code from all @mozilla's repositories that's marked as Markdown.   Search by the number of forks the parent repository has Much like with repositories, you can opt to search code files that exist within forked repositories. However, to ensure better relevancy, repository forks will not be searchable unless the fork has more stars than the parent repository. If you would like forked results to appear, add the fork:true qualifier. For example:  android language:java fork:true Matches code in a forked repository with the word \"android\" that's written in Java.   Search by the source code file size The size qualifier filters results based on the size of the file in which the code is found. For example:  function size:&gt;10000 language:python Matches code with the word \"function,\" written in Python, in files that are larger than 10 KB.   Search by the location of a file within the repository By including the path qualifier, you specify that resulting source code must appear at a specific location in a repository. Subfolders are considered during the search, so be as specific as possible. For example:  console path:app/public language:javascript Finds JavaScript files with the word \"console\" in an app/public directory (even if they reside in app/public/js/form-validators). form path:cgi-bin language:perl Finds Perl files under cgi-bin with the word \"form\" in them.   Search by filename You can use the filename qualifier if there's a specific file you're looking for. For example:  filename:.vimrc commands Finds *.vimrc* files with the word \"commands\" in them. minitest filename:test_helper path:test language:ruby Finds Ruby files containing the word \"minitest\" named *test_helper* within the *test* directory.   Search by the file extension The extension qualifier matches code files with a certain extension. For example:  form path:cgi-bin extension:pm Matches code with the word \"form,\" under cgi-bin, with the .pm extension. icon size:&gt;200000 extension:css Finds files larger than 200 KB that end in .css and have the word \"icon\" in them.   Search within a user's or organization's repositories To grab a list of code from all repositories owned by a certain user or organization, you can use the user syntax. For getting a list of code from a specific repository, you can use the repo syntax. For example:  user:github extension:rb Matches code from GitHub that ends in .rb. repo:mozilla/shumway extension:as Matches code from @mozilla's shumway project that ends in .as.   Sort the results With any of the qualifiers above, you can also choose to sort on when the code was last indexed. This can be in ascending or descending order.",

You have the power to protect yourself!  Make your password as strong as possible You probably already know that a good password is a word or sequence of at least 12 characters with a combination of lower- and upper-case letters, numbers, and special characters. However, a much better password is a passphrase with at least 16 characters. For example, \"canaries baseball clock dreams\" (with a hat tip to XKCD) is very strong and difficult to guess, but also easy for you to remember.  Don't share your password with anyone, ever (no, never) \"Sharing\" your password can be intentional or unintentional.  Intentionally sharing your password Telling anyone your password--even a potential collaborator on a repository--makes you vulnerable to security breaches. GitHub has a few different ways to let you collaborate with others and keep your account private.  Invite collaborators to your repository Create an organization and then add members to a team.   Unintentionally sharing your password If your password is tricky to remember, writing it down somewhere, such as on a piece of paper near your computer, is like not having a password at all. If anyone were to see that piece of paper, you'd be in big trouble. Instead, use a personal password manager such as LastPass, 1Password, or Keeper.  Keep your GitHub password different from those used for other accounts or services Your GitHub password should not only be unique to you, it should be unique to GitHub. Attackers know that people tend to reuse the same password for multiple accounts because they're easier to remember that way. If your password is guessed on another service, it could be guessed here on GitHub.  Warning: Security incidents at other companies have provided criminals with vast lists of valid user names, email addresses, and passwords that are used in attempts to access your encrypted data all over the internet.  Unless you have an award-winning memory, it can be very difficult to remember unique passwords for all accounts and services you use. To keep track of your passwords, use a personal password manager such as LastPass, 1Password, or Keeper.

      "body": " Use git push to push commits made on your local branch to a remote repository.  The git push command takes two arguments:  A remote name, for example, origin  A branch name, for example, master   For example:  git push  &lt;REMOTENAME&gt; &lt;BRANCHNAME&gt;   As an example, you usually run git push origin master to push your local changes to your online repository.  Renaming branches To rename a branch, you'd use the same git push command, but you would add one more argument: the name of the new branch. For example:  git push  &lt;REMOTENAME&gt; &lt;LOCALBRANCHNAME&gt;:&lt;REMOTEBRANCHNAME&gt;   This pushes the LOCALBRANCHNAME to your REMOTENAME, but it is renamed to REMOTEBRANCHNAME.  Dealing with \"non-fast-forward\" errors If your local copy of a repository is out of sync with, or \"behind,\" the upstream repository you're pushing to, you'll get a message saying non-fast-forward updates were rejected. This means that you must retrieve, or \"fetch,\" the upstream changes, before you are able to push your local changes. For more information on this error, see \"Dealing with non-fast-forward errors.\"  Pushing tags By default, and without additional parameters, git push sends all matching branches that have the same names as remote branches. To push a single tag, you can issue the same command as pushing a branch:  git push  &lt;REMOTENAME&gt; &lt;TAGNAME&gt;   To push all your tags, you can type the command:  git push  &lt;REMOTENAME&gt; --tags   Deleting a remote branch or tag The syntax to delete a branch is a bit arcane at first glance:  git push  &lt;REMOTENAME&gt; :&lt;BRANCHNAME&gt;   Note that there is a space before the colon. The command resembles the same steps you'd take to rename a branch. However, here, you're telling Git to push nothing into BRANCHNAME on REMOTENAME. Because of this, git push deletes the branch on the remote repository.  Remotes and forks You might already know that you can \"fork\" repositories on GitHub. When you clone a repository you own, you provide it with a remote URL that tells Git where to fetch and push updates. If you want to collaborate with the original repository, you'd add a new remote URL, typically called upstream, to your local Git clone:  git remote add upstream  &lt;THEIR_REMOTE_URL&gt;   Now, you can fetch updates and branches from their fork:  git fetch upstream # Grab the upstream remote's branches remote: Counting objects: 75, done. remote: Compressing objects: 100% (53/53), done. remote: Total 62 (delta 27), reused 44 (delta 9) Unpacking objects: 100% (62/62), done. From https://github.com/octocat/repo  * [new branch] master -&gt; upstream/master  When you're done making local changes, you can push your local branch to GitHub and initiate a pull request.

If the pull request does have merge conflicts, or if you'd like to test the changes before merging, you can check out the pull request locally and merge it using the command line. If you decide you don't want the changes in a topic branch to be merged to the upstream branch, you can close the pull request without merging. To merge a pull request into a protected branch with required pull request reviews enabled, the pull request must meet the review policy. In this policy, a pull request:  Must have one or more approved reviews Can't have any reviews that request changes  Repository owners and administrators can merge pull requests on branches that have required pull request reviews enabled, regardless of whether the pull request has been approved. You can enforce all users, including repository owners and administrators, to obtain an approval before merging a pull request to a protected branch. For more information, see \"Enabling required reviews for pull requests.\" If a person who requested changes isn't available to give an approved review, or if a pull request has changed significantly since it was reviewed, repository administrators or people with write access can dismiss a review. For more information, see \"Dismissing a pull request review.\" After all required reviewers have approved a pull request, you won't be able to merge it if there are other open pull requests with pending or rejected reviews and those pull requests have a head branch pointing to the same commit. Someone with write or admin permissions will need to approve or dismiss the blocking review on the other pull requests before you can merge.  Merging a pull request on GitHub  Under your repository name, click  Pull requests.  In the \"Pull Requests\" list, click the pull request you'd like to merge.  Depending on the merge options enabled for your repository, you can:   Merge all of the commits into the base branch by clicking Merge pull request. If the Merge pull request option is not shown, then click the merge drop down menu and select Create a merge commit.    Squash the commits into one commit by clicking the merge drop down menu, selecting Squash and merge and then clicking the Squash and merge button.    Rebase the commits individually onto the base branch by clicking the merge drop down menu, selecting Rebase and merge and then clicking the Rebase and merge button.   Note: Rebase and merge will always update the committer information and create new commit SHAs. For more information, see \"About pull request merges.\"     If you clicked Merge pull request or Squash and merge in step 3, type a commit message, or accept the default message. Under the commit message box, click Confirm merge or Confirm squash and merge.  If you clicked Rebase and merge in step 3, click Confirm rebase and merge. Optionally, delete the branch. This keeps the list of branches in your repository tidy.  Pull requests are merged using the --no-ff option, except for pull requests with squashed or rebased commits, which are merged using the fast-forward option.

      "body": "Thank you for using GitHub! We're happy you're here. Please read this Terms of Service agreement carefully before accessing or using GitHub. Because it is such an important contract between us and our users, we have tried to make it as clear as possible.

Changes to these Terms of Service We may modify this agreement, but we will give you 30 days' notice of changes that affect your rights.   Q. Miscellaneous Please see this section for legal details including our choice of law.     The GitHub Terms of Service Effective date: February 28, 2017  A. Definitions Short version: We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.  The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the \"Terms\") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at github.com/site/privacy) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at help.github.com/categories/site-policy. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at github.com, and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as education.github.com and pages.github.com. These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as CodeConf.com and product websites, such as atom.io. Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the account; or that directs the use of the account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government accounts (See Section B(4): Additional Terms). “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. \"Content\" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. “Paid Content” is Content only available to Users who are participating in a payment plan, including private repositories.   B. Account Terms Short version: A human must create your account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free account. You alone are responsible for your account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your account. You are responsible for keeping your account secure.  1. Required Information You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a paid account, in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.  2. Account Requirements We have a few simple rules for accounts on GitHub's Service.  You must be a human to create an account. Accounts registered by \"bots\" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:  A machine account is an account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free personal account. One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine). You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will terminate that User’s account immediately. If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws. Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid organization account may create separate logins for as many users as its subscription allows. Overall, the number of Users must not exceed the number of accounts you've ordered from us.   3. User Account Security You are responsible for keeping your account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your account's security, but the content of your account and its security are up to you.  You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your account (even when content is posted by others who have accounts under your account). You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation. You will promptly notify GitHub if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your account, including any unauthorized use of your password or account.   4. Additional Terms In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you. If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service applies to you, and you agree to its provisions. If you have signed up for a Business plan, the Business Plan Addendum applies to you, and you agree to its provisions. If you are an owner or administrator of an Organization on GitHub, additional terms may govern your relationship with us and supersede this Agreement.  C. Acceptable Use Short version: GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow this Acceptable Use Policy, which includes some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.  1. Compliance with Laws and Regulations Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.  2. Content Restrictions You agree that you will not under any circumstances upload, post, host, or transmit any content that:  is unlawful or promotes unlawful activities; is or contains sexually obscene content; is libelous, defamatory, or fraudulent; is discriminatory or abusive toward any individual or group; contains or installs any active malware or exploits, or uses our platform for exploit delivery (such as part of a command and control system); or infringes on any proprietary right of any party, including patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, right of publicity, or other rights.   3. Conduct Restrictions While using GitHub, you agree that you will not under any circumstances:  harass, abuse, threaten, or incite violence towards any individual or group, including GitHub employees, officers, and agents, or other GitHub Users; use our servers for any form of excessive automated bulk activity (for example, spamming), or relay any other form of unsolicited advertising or solicitation through our servers, such as get-rich-quick schemes; attempt to disrupt or tamper with GitHub's servers in ways that could harm our Website or Service, to place undue burden on GitHub's servers through automated means, or to access GitHub's Service in ways that exceed your authorization (other than those authorized by the GitHub Bug Bounty program); impersonate any person or entity, including any of our employees or representatives, including through false association with GitHub, or by fraudulently misrepresenting your identity or site's purpose; or violate the privacy of any third party, such as by posting another person's personal information without consent.   4. Services Usage Limits You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the Service, use of the Service, or access to the Service without GitHub's express written permission.  5. Scraping Scraping refers to extracting data from our Website via an automated process, such as a bot or webcrawler. It does not refer to the collection of information through GitHub's API. Please see Section G for our API Terms. You may scrape the website for the following reasons:  Researchers may scrape public, non-personal information from GitHub for research purposes, only if any publications resulting from that research are open access. Archivists may scrape GitHub for public data for archival purposes.  You may not scrape GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards. All use of GitHub data gathered through scraping must comply with the GitHub Privacy Statement.  6. Privacy Misuse of GitHub Users' Personal Information is prohibited. Any person, entity, or service collecting data from GitHub must comply with the GitHub Privacy Statement, particularly in regards to the collection of our Users' Personal Information (as defined in the GitHub Privacy Statement). If you collect any GitHub User's Personal Information from GitHub, you agree that you will only use the Personal Information you gather for the purpose for which our User has authorized it. You agree that you will reasonably secure any Personal Information you have gathered from GitHub, and you will respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and \"do not contact\" requests from GitHub or GitHub Users.  7. Excessive Bandwidth Use If we determine your bandwidth usage to be significantly excessive in relation to other GitHub customers, we reserve the right to suspend your account or throttle your file hosting until you can reduce your bandwidth consumption.  8. User Protection You agree not to engage in activity that significantly harms our Users. We will resolve disputes in favor of protecting our Users as a whole.  D. User-Generated Content Short version: You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close accounts if we need to.  1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content You may create User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.  2. Ownership of Content and Right to Post You retain ownership of and responsibility for Content you create. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself, you agree that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post, and you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.  3. GitHub May Remove Content We do not pre-screen User-Generated Content, but we have the right (though not the obligation) to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any GitHub terms or policies.  4. License Grant to Us Your Content belongs to you, and you are responsible for Content you post even if it does not belong to you. However, we need the legal right to do things like host it, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store and display your Content and make incidental copies as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.  That means you're giving us the right to do things like reproduce your content (so we can do things like copy it to our database and make backups); display it (so we can do things like show it to you and other users); modify it (so our server can do things like parse it into a search index); distribute it (so we can do things like share it with other users); and perform it (in case your content is something like music or video).  This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell your Content or otherwise distribute it outside of our Service.  5. License Grant to Other Users Any Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and \"fork\" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of your Content in repositories they control). If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to access your Content through the GitHub Service, and to use, display and perform your Content, and to reproduce your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality. You may grant further rights if you adopt a license.  6. Contributions Under Repository License Whenever you make a contribution to a repository containing notice of a license, you license your contribution under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license your contribution under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license your contributions under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supercede. Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand \"inbound=outbound\". We're just making it explicit.   7. Moral Rights You retain all moral rights to Content you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in this Section. To the extent such an agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub a nonexclusive, revocable, worldwide, royalty-free right to (1) use the Content without attribution strictly as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service; and (2) make reasonable adaptations of the Content as provided in this Section. We need these rights to allow basic functions like search to work.   8. Private Repositories Paid accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content. GitHub employees only access private repositories when access is required for security or maintenance or for support reasons, and then only with the consent of the repository owner. Because we respect your privacy in private repositories, you must respect the Terms of Service in everything you post to a private repository. If we have reason to believe the contents of a private repository are in violation of the law or of these Terms, we have the right to remove them.  E. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy. If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via our convenient DMCA form or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses. We will terminate the accounts of repeat infringers of this policy.  F. Intellectual Property Notice Short version: We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.  1. GitHub's Rights to Content GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved.

API Terms Short version: You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section G, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.  1. Limitation of Liability for API Use You understand and agree that GitHub is not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including but not limited to damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (even if GitHub has been advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting from your use of the API or third-party products that access data via the API.  2. No Abuse or Overuse of the API Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension. You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations. You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards. All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the GitHub Privacy Statement. GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.  3. GitHub May Terminate Your Use of the API We reserve the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, your access to the API or any part of it with or without notice.  H. Additional Terms for GitHub Pages Short version: The GitHub Pages hosting service is subject to certain rules, in addition to the rest of the Terms. Each GitHub account comes with access to the GitHub Pages static hosting service. This hosting service is intended to host static web pages for GitHub users. GitHub Pages are subject to some specific bandwidth and usage limits, and may not be appropriate for some high-bandwidth uses. Please see our GitHub Pages guidelines for more information. GitHub reserves the right at all times to reclaim any GitHub subdomain without liability.  I. Advertising on GitHub Short version: We do not generally prohibit use of GitHub for advertising. However, we expect our users to follow certain limitations, so GitHub does not become a spam haven. No one wants that.  1. GitHub Pages We offer Pages sites primarily as a showcase for personal and organizational projects. Some monetization efforts are permitted on Pages, such as donation buttons and crowdfunding links.  2. GitHub Repositories GitHub repositories are intended to host Content. You may include static images, links, and promotional text in the README documents associated with your repositories, but they must be related to the project you are hosting on GitHub. You may not advertise in other Users' repositories, such as by posting monetized or excessive bulk content in issues.  3. Spamming and Inappropriate Use of GitHub Advertising Content, like all Content, must not violate the law or these Terms of Use, for example through excessive bulk activity such as spamming. We reserve the right to remove any advertisements that, in our sole discretion, violate any GitHub terms or policies.  J. Payment Short version: You are responsible for any fees associated with your use of GitHub. We are responsible for communicating those fees to you clearly and accurately, and letting you know well in advance if those prices change.  1. Pricing Our pricing and payment terms are available at github.com/pricing. If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.  2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes  We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan. If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date. If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately. You may change your level of service at any time by choosing a plan option or going into your Billing settings. If you choose to downgrade your account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your account. Please see our section on Cancellation for information on getting a copy of that Content.   3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds  For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.   4. Authorization By agreeing to these Terms, you are giving us permission to charge your on-file credit card, PayPal account, or other approved methods of payment for fees that you authorize for GitHub.  5. Responsibility for Payment You are responsible for all fees, including taxes, associated with your use of the Service. By using the Service, you agree to pay GitHub any charge incurred in connection with your use of the Service. If you dispute the matter, contact GitHub Support. You are responsible for providing us with a valid means of payment for paid accounts. Free accounts are not required to provide payment information.  K. Cancellation and Termination Short version: You may close your account at any time. If you do, we'll treat your information responsibly.  1. Account Cancellation It is your responsibility to properly cancel your account with GitHub. You can cancel your account at any time by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel accounts in response to an email or phone request.  2. Upon Cancellation We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information can not be recovered once your account is cancelled. We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked. Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing account contents after account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.  3. GitHub May Terminate GitHub has the right to suspend or terminate your access to all or any part of the Website at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. GitHub reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.  4. Survival All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination will survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.  L. Communications with GitHub Short version: We use email and other electronic means to stay in touch with our users.  1. Electronic Communication Required For contractual purposes, you (1) consent to receive communications from us in an electronic form via the email address you have submitted or via the Service; and (2) agree that all Terms of Service, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that those communications would satisfy if they were on paper. This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.  2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing Communications made through email or GitHub Support's messaging system will not constitute legal notice to GitHub or any of its officers, employees, agents or representatives in any situation where notice to GitHub is required by contract or any law or regulation. Legal notice to GitHub must be in writing and served on GitHub's legal agent.  3. No Phone Support GitHub only offers support via email, in-Service communications, and electronic messages. We do not offer telephone support.  M. Disclaimer of Warranties Short version: We provide our service as is, and we make no promises or guarantees about this service. Please read this section carefully; you should understand what to expect. GitHub provides the Website and the Service “as is” and “as available,” without warranty of any kind. Without limiting this, we expressly disclaim all warranties, whether express, implied or statutory, regarding the Website and the Service including without limitation any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, security, accuracy and non-infringement. GitHub does not warrant that the Service will meet your requirements; that the Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free; that the information provided through the Service is accurate, reliable or correct; that any defects or errors will be corrected; that the Service will be available at any particular time or location; or that the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components. You assume full responsibility and risk of loss resulting from your downloading and/or use of files, information, content or other material obtained from the Service.  N. Limitation of Liability Short version: We will not be liable for damages or losses arising from your use or inability to use the service or otherwise arising under this agreement. Please read this section carefully; it limits our obligations to you. You understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however arising, that result from  the use, disclosure, or display of your User-Generated Content; your use or inability to use the Service; any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Service; the Service generally or the software or systems that make the Service available; unauthorized access to or alterations of your transmissions or data; statements or conduct of any third party on the Service; any other user interactions that you input or receive through your use of the Service; or any other matter relating to the Service.  Our liability is limited whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damages, and even if a remedy set forth in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose. We will have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond our reasonable control.  O. Release and Indemnification Short version: You are responsible for your use of the service. If you harm someone else or get into a dispute with someone else, we will not be involved. If you have a dispute with one or more Users, you agree to release GitHub from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes. You agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement, provided that GitHub (1) promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (2) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub of all liability); and (3) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.  P. Changes to These Terms Short version: We want our users to be informed of important changes to our terms, but some changes aren't that important — we don't want to bother you every time we fix a typo. So while we may modify this agreement at any time, we will notify users of any changes that affect your rights and give you time to adjust to them. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments. We will notify our Users of material changes to this Agreement, such as price changes, at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our Website. For non-material modifications, your continued use of the Website constitutes agreement to our revisions of these Terms of Service. We reserve the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Website (or any part of it) with or without notice.  Q. Miscellaneous  1. Governing Law Except to the extent applicable law provides otherwise, this Agreement between you and GitHub and any access to or use of the Website or the Service are governed by the federal laws of the United States of America and the laws of the State of California, without regard to conflict of law provisions. You and GitHub agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts located in the City and County of San Francisco, California.  2. Non-Assignability GitHub may assign or delegate these Terms of Service and/or the GitHub Privacy Statement, in whole or in part, to any person or entity at any time with or without your consent, including the license grant in Section D.4. You may not assign or delegate any rights or obligations under the Terms of Service or Privacy Statement without our prior written consent, and any unauthorized assignment and delegation by you is void.  3. Section Headings and Summaries Throughout this Agreement, each section includes titles and brief summaries of the following terms and conditions. These section titles and brief summaries are not legally binding.  4. Severability, No Waiver, and Survival If any part of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion of the Agreement will be construed to reflect the parties’ original intent. The remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. Any failure on the part of GitHub to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not be considered a waiver of our right to enforce such provision. Our rights under this Agreement will survive any termination of this Agreement.  5. Complete Agreement These Terms of Service, together with the GitHub Privacy Statement, represent the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between you and us. This Agreement supersedes any proposal or prior agreement oral or written, and any other communications between you and GitHub relating to the subject matter of these terms.  6.

      "body": "\"Depending on how you configured two-factor authentication, your authentication code will either be generated by an application or delivered to your phone via text message. You can choose to switch between delivery methods at any time.\" GitHub will only ask you to provide your 2FA authentication code again if you've logged out, are using a new device, or your session expires.  If your authentication fails several times, you may wish to synchronize your phone's clock with your mobile provider. Often, this involves checking the \"Set automatically\" option on your phone's clock, rather than providing your own time zone.   Generating a code through a TOTP application If you chose to set up two-factor authentication using a TOTP application on your smartphone, you can generate an authentication code for GitHub at any time. After entering your username and password, you'll be asked for your \"Two-factor authentication code\". In most cases, just launching the application will generate a new code. You should refer to your application's documentation for specific instructions. You can then enter this code to gain access to your account. If you delete the mobile application after configuring two-factor authentication, you'll need to provide your recovery code to get access to your account.  Using a FIDO U2F compatible security key  Note: FIDO U2F authentication is currently only available for the Chrome browser.  If you set up two-factor authentication via a security key, you can authenticate to GitHub on your computer or compatible Android phone with Near Field Communication (NFC) support instead of using codes generated by a TOTP application or text message. For specific instructions for authenticating with a security key, see the documentation for your device. Authentication with a security key is secondary to authentication with a TOTP application or a text message. You'll still need to set up 2FA using a TOTP application or a text message before being able to enable a security key. If you lose your hardware key, you'll still be able to use your phone's code to sign in.  Receiving a text message If you set up two-factor authentication via text messages, GitHub will send you a text message with your authentication code. After entering your username and password, you'll be asked for your \"Two-factor authentication code.\" This will automatically be delivered to your phone via text message. You can then enter this code to gain access to your account.  When you'll be asked for a 2FA code After 2FA is enabled there are several scenarios where you'll be asked to provide your 2FA code:  Through the web If you sign into GitHub through the website, you'll be provided with the following prompt asking for your 2FA code:   If you're providing a recovery code you previously downloaded from GitHub, you will need to click the Enter a two-factor recovery code link and follow the instructions for entering your recovery code instead of entering it in the Authentication Code box.   Through the API With 2FA enabled, you'll need to pass along a special header containing your 2FA authentication code. More information can be found within our Developer Documentation.   Through GitHub Desktop After setting up 2FA and reauthenticating to GitHub, you'll be provided with the following prompt asking for your 2FA code:  Depending on how you set up your account, you'll be presented with a dialog asking you to enter your 2FA code. If you set up 2FA through SMS, we'll text it to you. Otherwise, you can generate one from your TOTP application.    Through GitHub Desktop After setting up 2FA and reauthenticating to GitHub, you'll be provided with the following prompt asking for your 2FA code:  Depending on how you set up your account, you'll be presented with a dialog asking you to enter your 2FA code. If you set up 2FA through SMS, we'll text it to you. Otherwise, you can generate one from your TOTP application.   When you'll be asked for a personal access token as a password After 2FA is enabled there are a couple of scenarios where you need to enter a personal access token instead of a 2FA code and your GitHub password.  Through the command line You must create a personal access token to use as a password when authenticating to GitHub on the command line using HTTPS URLs. For example, when you access a repository using Git on the command line using commands like git clone, git fetch, git pull or git push with HTTPS URLs, you must provide your GitHub username and your personal access token when prompted for a username and password. The command line prompt won't specify that you should enter your personal access token when it asks for your password.   2FA and Subversion (svn command line, tortoise svn, etc) When you access a repository via Subversion, you must provide a personal access token instead of entering your password.  When you'll be asked for your SSH key passphrase as a password If you have authenticated to GitHub on the command line using SSH URLs you must enter an SSH key passphrase instead of a 2FA code and your GitHub password after 2FA is enabled.  For example, when you access a repository using Git on the command line using commands like git clone, git fetch, git pull or git push with SSH URLs, you must provide your SSH key passphrase when prompted for a password. The command line prompt won't specify that you should enter your SSH key passphrase when it asks for your password. ",

Be sure to read this Agreement carefully – you can only be a pre-release program participant if you accept all the terms of this Agreement. By clicking the “Register for the GitHub Pre-Release Program” button, or by participating as a pre-release program participant in any way – for example, by accessing information about GitHub products or services that aren’t yet available to the general public – you’re agreeing to be bound by all the terms of this Agreement. IF YOU’RE ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE LEGAL AUTHORITY TO BIND THE ENTITY TO THIS AGREEMENT, IN WHICH CASE \"YOU\" WILL MEAN THE ENTITY YOU REPRESENT. IF YOU DON’T HAVE SUCH AUTHORITY, OR IF YOU DON’T AGREE WITH THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU MUST NOT CLICK THE \"REGISTER FOR THE GITHUB PRE-RELEASE PROGRAM\" BUTTON, AND YOU CAN’T BE A PRE-RELEASE PROGRAM PARTICIPANT. IF YOU’RE A COMPANY OR OTHER LEGAL ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT THE PERSON CLICKING THE \"REGISTER FOR THE GITHUB PRE-RELEASE PROGRAM\" BUTTON HAS THE AUTHORITY TO BIND YOU TO THIS AGREEMENT.  1. GitHub.com’s Terms of Use or the GitHub Enterprise Software License Agreement Will Apply You need to have an account on GitHub.com or on a licensed instance of GitHub Enterprise in order to be a pre-release program participant. In addition to the GitHub.com Terms of Service or your applicable GitHub Enterprise License Agreement, as applicable, (the \"Generally Applicable Terms\"), by clicking the \"Register for the GitHub Pre-Release Program\" button, you are also agreeing to be bound by this Agreement, such that both agreements will apply to you concurrently. In the event of a direct conflict between this Agreement and the Generally Applicable Terms, your Generally Applicable Terms will control, except with respect to any use of Pre-Release Materials, in which case this Agreement will control.  2. Confidentiality; Access to Pre-Release Materials As a pre-release program participant, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.  You agree that any non-public information we give you, or that you may have access to as a pre-release program participant, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluation of the Pre-Release Materials (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your confidential information but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party other than your employees and contractors, and then only to the extent that: (i) they need to know the Confidential Information for the Purpose; (ii) you make them aware of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information; (iii) you remain responsible for the acts and omissions of such employees and contractors; and (iv) we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure. You understand that unauthorized disclosure or use of our Confidential Information could cause us irreparable harm, and significant injury that may be difficult for us to quantify. Accordingly, you agree that we’ll have the right to seek immediate injunctive relief to make sure you comply with this Agreement, in addition to any other rights and remedies we may have. If you are required by law, regulation or a valid binding order of a court of competent jurisdiction to disclose our Confidential Information, you may do so, but only if you notify us before you do, and do your best to limit such disclosure and to seek confidential, protective treatment of such information. The obligations in this Section 2 won’t apply to information that you can prove: (i) was generally available to the public before we disclosed it to you; (ii) became generally available to the public after we disclosed it to you, through no action or inaction on your part, or on the part of your employees or contractors; (iii) you knew about before we disclosed it to you; (iv) was disclosed to you by a third party, who didn’t have any confidentiality obligations with respect to it; (v) you independently developed without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (vi) we gave you permission to disclose, in a writing signed by one of our authorized representatives. If we give you access to any software, pre-release software or related documentation or materials, which may include videos or other forms of content (“Pre-Release Materials”), then subject to your compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and your Generally Applicable Terms, we hereby grant you a nonexclusive, nontransferable, revocable right and license to use the Pre-Release Materials during the term of this Agreement, solely for the Purpose. If the Pre-Release Materials are accompanied by a separate license agreement, you agree that the separate license agreement (in addition to any more restrictive provisions contained in this Agreement or your Generally Applicable Terms) will apply. You agree not to decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, or otherwise reduce the Pre-Release Materials to a human-perceivable form, and you promise not to modify, network, rent, lease, transmit, sell, or loan the Pre-Release Materials, in whole or in part. You understand that we’re under no obligation to provide any Pre-Release Materials to you, to provide you with updates, enhancements, or corrections to the Pre-Release Materials, or to notify you of changes that we make to our products and services, now or in the future.  3. Term and Termination This Agreement begins on the date you click “Agree”, and continues for a period of one (1) year. This Agreement will automatically renew for successive one-year terms unless either party gives written notice at least thirty (30) days before the current term expires that it wants to terminate, or one party terminates it earlier in accordance with this Section 3. Either you or GitHub may terminate this Agreement for any reason, without cause, upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the other. This Agreement will terminate immediately, without the requirement of notice, if you breach any term of this Agreement or your Generally Applicable Terms.  The rights and obligations in Sections 1, 2, and 4 through 17 will survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement all of the rights and licenses we granted you in this Agreement will immediately cease to exist, you will return (or, at our request, destroy) all of our Confidential Information and any copies (including electronic copies) which are in your possession or control, and you will certify in writing that you’ve complied with these requirements.  4. Warranties and Disclaimers You warrant to us that you: (i) have the authority to execute this Agreement and to perform its obligations; (ii) will make no false or misleading statements or representations regarding GitHub or our products and services; and (iii) will not take on any obligation or responsibility, or make any representation, warranty, guarantee or endorsement to anyone on our behalf (including, without limitation, any of our products or services). YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT ANY MATERIALS OR INFORMATION THAT WE GIVE YOU OR THAT YOU HAVE ACCESS TO UNDER THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OR PRE-RELEASE MATERIALS) ARE PROVIDED “AS IS”, AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. WE SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.  5. Indemnity We’ll be giving you access to lots of useful pre-release products, services, and information, such as the Pre-Release Materials, and there are ways that you could use them improperly that could cause us harm. With that in mind, and since we can’t control the ways that you use what we give you, you agree that you will indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims which may arise under or out of your participation in any pre-release program; your negligence or intentional misconduct; any misrepresentations you make with respect to us, or our products or services; or your violation of any part of this Agreement.  6. Limitation of Liability IN NO EVENT WILL WE BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DAMAGES FOR LOST DATA, LOST PROFITS OR COSTS OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, HOWEVER CAUSED AND UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION PRODUCTS LIABILITY, STRICT LIABILITY AND NEGLIGENCE), OR ANY OTHER THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT WE KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. IN NO EVENT WILL OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT FOR ANY CAUSE WHATSOEVER, AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR IN TORT, EXCEED THE GREATER OF (I) AMOUNTS YOU ACTUALLY PAID US UNDER THIS AGREEMENT; OR (II) FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($500). THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THE FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY STATED IN THIS AGREEMENT.  7. Export Control You aren’t allowed to export or re-export any of our Confidential Information, except as authorized by United States law and the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Confidential Information was obtained. In particular, you aren’t allowed to export or re-export our Confidential Information into any U.S. embargoed countries, to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals, or to anyone on the U.S. Department of Commerce Denied Person's List or Entity List. By participating in a pre-release program or receiving any of our Confidential Information, you represent and warrant that you are not located in any such country or on any such list.  8. Proprietary Rights You agree that GitHub and its licensors own all right, title and interest in and to the Pre-Release Materials, and all other GitHub products and services; all information and data relating to their configurations and combinations; and all modifications to and derivative works of any of the foregoing. You agree not to remove, alter, cover or obfuscate any copyright or other proprietary rights notices we place on or embed in the Pre-Release Materials, or any other GitHub products and services.  9. Government Users If you are a Government entity, this Section applies to you. Certain of our Confidential Information may be considered “Commercial Items”, as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. §2.101, consisting of “Commercial Computer Software” and “Commercial Computer Software Documentation”, as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. §12.212 or 48 C.F.R. §227.7202, as applicable.

To work with Git, you'll need to be comfortable with our GitHub Desktop or command line tutorials.   Cloning wikis locally to your computer Every wiki provides an easy way to clone its contents down to your computer:  If you're using GitHub Desktop, click Clone in Desktop to copy the wiki to your computer. Otherwise, you can use the following command with the provided URL to clone the wiki repository to your computer.  git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY.wiki.git # Clones the wiki locally  Once you have cloned the wiki, you can add new files, edit existing ones, and commit your changes. You and your collaborators can create branches when working on wikis, but only changes pushed to the master branch will be made live and available to your readers.  Naming wiki files The filename determines the title of your wiki page, and the file extension determines how your wiki content is rendered. Wikis use our open-source Markup library to convert the markup, and it determines which converter to use by a file's extension. For example, if you name a file foo.md or foo.markdown, wiki will use the Markdown converter, while a file named foo.textile will use the Textile converter.  Warnings:  Don't use the following characters in your wiki page's titles: \\ / : * ? \" &lt; &gt; |. Users on certain operating systems won't be able to work with filenames containing these characters. Be sure to write your content using a markup language that matches the extension, or your content won't render properly.    Creating footers and sidebars locally You can add a custom sidebar or footer to your wiki to provide readers with more contextual information. This is easy to do online, but you can create and edit these elements locally, too. If you create a file named _Footer. or _Sidebar., we'll use them to populate the footer and sidebar of your wiki, respectively. Note that the underscore and the capitalization in the filename is very important. Like every other wiki page, the extension you choose for these files determines how we render them.",

With SAML SSO, organization administrators can invite members to connect their existing GitHub user accounts to a supported IdP. SAML SSO gives organizations a centralized and secure way of controlling access to their resources on GitHub and helps organization members maintain control of their identity and contributions. Organization members sign in through the organization's IdP and their existing GitHub account is linked to an external identity that belongs to the organization. This external identity is separate from, but related to, their GitHub account and is used to control access to the organization's resources like repositories, issues, and pull requests. GitHub supports these identity providers for SAML SSO:  Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Okta OneLogin PingOne Shibboleth Custom applications  SAML SSO can be disabled, enabled but not enforced, or enabled and enforced. For more information on setting up and enforcing SAML SSO for your GitHub organization, see \"Connecting your identity provider to your organization\" and \"Enforcing SAML single sign-on for your organization.\" You must periodically log in to your SAML provider to authenticate and gain access to the organization's resources on GitHub. The duration of this login period is specified by your IdP and is generally 24 hours. This periodic login requirement limits the length of access and requires you to re-identify yourself to continue.  Note: Outside collaborators aren't required to have an external (SAML) identity to access an organization that uses SAML SSO.  Members will be required to authorize personal access tokens to access the organization's protected resources using the API and Git on the command line. Organization administrators can revoke the access token at any time. For more information, see \"Viewing and revoking organization members' authorized access to tokens.\"  Note: If your IdP supports SCIM, members are automatically invited to join the GitHub organization when access is provisioned in your IdP and will be automatically removed from the GitHub organization when their access is removed from your IdP.

      "body": " The git rebase command allows you to easily change a series of commits, modifying the history of your repository. You can reorder, edit, or squash commits together.  Typically, you would use git rebase to:  Edit previous commit messages Combine multiple commits into one Delete or revert commits that are no longer necessary   Warning: Because changing your commit history can make things difficult for everyone else using the repository, it's considered bad practice to rebase commits when you've already pushed to a repository. To learn how to safely rebase on GitHub, see \"About pull request merges.\"    Rebasing commits against a branch To rebase all the commits between another branch and the current branch state, you can enter the following command in your shell (either the command prompt for Windows, or the terminal for Mac and Linux):  git rebase --interactive other_branch_name   Rebasing commits against a point in time To rebase the last few commits in your current branch, you can enter the following command in your shell:  git rebase --interactive HEAD~7   Commands available while rebasing There are six commands available while rebasing:  pick  pick simply means that the commit is included. Rearranging the order of the pick commands changes the order of the commits when the rebase is underway. If you choose not to include a commit, you should delete the entire line.  reword The reword command is similar to pick, but after you use it, the rebase process will pause and give you a chance to alter the commit message. Any changes made by the commit are not affected.  edit If you choose to edit a commit, you'll be given the chance to amend the commit, meaning that you can add or change the commit entirely. You can also make more commits before you continue the rebase. This allows you to split a large commit into smaller ones, or, remove erroneous changes made in a commit.  squash This command lets you combine two or more commits into a single commit. A commit is squashed into the commit above it. Git gives you the chance to write a new commit message describing both changes. fixup This is similar to squash, but the commit to be merged has its message discarded. The commit is simply merged into the commit above it, and the earlier commit's message is used to describe both changes. exec This lets you run arbitrary shell commands against a commit.   An example of using git rebase  No matter which command you use, Git will launch your default text editor and open a file that details the commits in the range you've chosen. That file looks something like this: pick 1fc6c95 Patch A pick 6b2481b Patch B pick dd1475d something I want to split pick c619268 A fix for Patch B pick fa39187 something to add to patch A pick 4ca2acc i cant' typ goods pick 7b36971 something to move before patch B # Rebase 41a72e6..7b36971 onto 41a72e6 # # Commands: # p, pick = use commit # r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message # e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending # s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit # f, fixup = like \"squash\", but discard this commit's log message # x, exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shell # # If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST. # However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted. #  Breaking this information, from top to bottom, we see that:  Seven commits are listed, which indicates that there were seven changes between our starting point and our current branch state. The commits you chose to rebase are sorted in the order of the oldest changes (at the top) to the newest changes (at the bottom). Each line lists a command (by default, pick), the commit SHA, and the commit message. The entire git rebase procedure centers around your manipulation of these three columns. The changes you make are rebased onto your repository. After the commits, Git tells you the range of commits we're working with (41a72e6..7b36971). Finally, Git gives some help by telling you the commands that are available to you when rebasing commits.

      "body": "Git LFS is available for every repository on GitHub, whether or not your account or organization has a paid plan. All personal and organization accounts using Git LFS receive 1 GB of free storage and 1 GB a month of free bandwidth. If the bandwidth and storage quotas are not enough, you can choose to purchase an additional quota for Git LFS.  Tracking storage and bandwidth use When you commit and push a change to a file tracked with Git LFS, a new version of the entire file is pushed, and the total file size is counted against storage and bandwidth limits. For example, if you push a 500 MB file to Git LFS, you'll use 500 MB of your allotted storage and 500 MB of your bandwidth. If you make a 1 byte change to the file and push again, you'll use another 500 MB of storage and 500 MB of bandwidth, bringing your total usage for these two pushes to 1 GB of storage and 1 GB of bandwidth.  Tips:  Bandwidth and storage usage only count against the repository owner's quotas. Anyone with write access to a repository can push files to Git LFS without affecting their personal bandwidth and storage quotas or purchasing data packs. Pushing large files to forks of a repository count against the parent repository's bandwidth and storage quotas. Unused bandwidth doesn't roll over month-to-month.    Storage quota If you use more than 1 GB of storage without purchasing a data pack, you can still clone repositories with large assets, but you will only retrieve the pointer files, and you will not be able to push new files back up.  Bandwidth quota If you use more than 1 GB of bandwidth per month without purchasing a data pack, Git LFS support is disabled on your account until the next month.  Purchasing additional storage and bandwidth Additional storage and bandwidth is offered in a single data pack. One data pack costs $5 per month, and provides a monthly quota of 50 GB for bandwidth and 50 GB for storage. You can purchase as many data packs as you need. For example, if you need 150 GB of storage, you'd buy three data packs. Purchasing data packs for Git LFS is independent of any other plan on GitHub.

      "url": "/articles/troubleshooting-custom-domains",
      "body": " Tip: If you've recently changed or removed your custom domain and can't access the new URL in your browser, you may need to clear your browser's cache to reach the new custom domain. For more information on clearing your cache, see your browser's help site.   GitHub repository setup errors  Tip: Custom domains are stored in a CNAME file in the root of your repository. You can add or update your custom domain through your repository settings. You can also edit the file directly to update your custom domain, although we recommend the procedure in \"Adding or removing a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site.\"   The CNAME file isn't properly formatted  The CNAME filename must be uppercase Only the bare domain or subdomain should be listed, e.g., example.com or blog.example.com, not https://example.com.  For more information on setting up your custom domain, see \"Adding or removing a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site.\"  Multiple domains in CNAME file A CNAME file can contain only one domain. To point multiple domains to the same Page, set up redirects through your DNS provider.  CNAME already taken If your custom domain is already used by another GitHub Pages site, you will receive a page build warning. When you add or edit your custom domain in your GitHub Pages site's repository settings, we automatically create a CNAME file in the root of your repository. A custom domain in a CNAME file can only be used once. Here are some examples of when you'll receive a page build warning for a duplicate custom domain:  If you have an apex domain such as example.com in your CNAME file, this means that either example.com or its www subdomain (www.example.com) has been used in a CNAME file in another repository and is being used by the corresponding GitHub Pages site. Likewise, if you have a www subdomain such as www.example.com in your CNAME file, this means that either www.example.com or its apex domain (example.com) has been used in a CNAME file in another repository and is being used by the corresponding GitHub Pages site.  If you own the other GitHub Pages repository that is using your custom domain in its CNAME file, then you must remove the custom domain from your other repository's CNAME file before you can use it in a different pages site repository. To remove the custom domain from a different GitHub Pages site repository you own, you can add a different custom domain to your GitHub Pages site or just remove your old custom domain. If you don't own the repository that contains the CNAME file with your custom domain, try to contact the owner and ask them to update their custom domain. If you're unsure which repository contains the CNAME file with your custom domain, contact GitHub Support.  Reached limit for User or Organization pages site You can only create one User or Organization pages site per GitHub account. For instance, there can only be one Organization pages site per organization account. Likewise, there can only be one User pages site per individual user account. Project pages sites are unlimited.  DNS configuration errors  Tip: If you have trouble pointing your GitHub Pages default domain to your custom domain, then contact your DNS provider for help. They can help confirm that you have configured your custom domain correctly.   DNS record doesn't point to GitHub's server In order to serve the Page, your DNS records must point to GitHub's server. To confirm that your custom domain points to GitHub's servers, use the dig command with your custom domain. The dig command shows you where your custom domain points. For example:  dig example.com +nostats +nocomments +nocmd example.com. 3600 IN A 192.30.252.153  In the example above, example.com points to the IP address 192.30.252.153. If you configured A records through your DNS provider, then your A records should point your custom domain to the following IP addresses:  192.30.252.153 192.30.252.154   Notes:  You may see a different IP address, since we serve Pages with a global Content Delivery Network. Use dig username.github.io to see the full resolution path. Note that DNS caching may cause a delay. If you're using an A record that points to 207.97.227.245 or 204.232.175.78, you'll need to update your DNS settings, as we no longer serve Pages directly from those servers.   If you configured ALIAS, ANAME, or CNAME records through your DNS provider, then you your DNS record should point to your GitHub Pages default domain, such as YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME.github.io. Your default GitHub Pages domain is determined by the type of pages site you have. For examples, see this domain chart. If you need help creating these records, contact your DNS provider as they should have the most detailed instructions. For some guidelines on configuring a DNS record with DNS providers, see \"Using a custom domain with GitHub Pages.\"  Unsupported custom domain name If your custom domain is unsupported then you may need to change your custom domain. You can also contact your DNS provider to see if they offer domain name forwarding services to redirect your site to an unsupported custom domain. Unsupported custom domains include:  using more than one apex domain (example.com and anotherexample.com) using more than one www subdomain (www.example.com and www.anotherexample.com) combination of an apex domain and custom subdomain (example.com and docs.example.com)   Danger: Do not use wildcard DNS records (e.g., *.example.com) with GitHub Pages! A wildcard DNS record will allow anyone to host a GitHub Pages site at one of your subdomains.  For a list of supported custom domains, see \"About supported custom domains.\"  URL formatting error on Linux  Warning: If the URL for your Pages site contains a username or organization name that begins or ends in a dash, or contains consecutive dashes, then people browsing with Linux will receive a server error when they visit the site. To fix this, change your GitHub username to remove non-alphanumeric characters. For instructions on how to do this, see \"Changing your GitHub username.\" ",

Any capitalized terms not defined in these Business Plan Terms will be defined in the Terms of Service or the Corporate Terms of Service. By agreeing to these Business Plan Terms, you also agree to the Terms of Service, as determined by the type of account you have.  Definitions:  Active User: means a user trying to access our Service at the time of an Outage. Customer: person or entity who has purchased a Business plan from GitHub. Eligible User: means an individual who is designated as a member of the Customer's Business plan organization by having their individual GitHub account associated with the Customer's Business plan account. Essential Services: means the services essential to GitHub's core version control functionality, including features and services such as creating, forking, and cloning repositories; creating, committing, and merging branches; creating, reviewing, and merging pull requests; and, web, API, and Git client interfaces to the core Git workflows. The following are examples of peripheral features and services not included: webhooks, Gists, Pages, or email notifications. Outage: means the interruption of an Essential Service that affects more than 50% of Active Users. Scheduled Downtime: means maintenance or updates to the Service (including to any servers or other hardware required to host the Service), which has been scheduled in advance, during which the Service may be down or inaccessible to Users. Service Credit: a dollar credit, calculated as set forth below, that we may credit back to an eligible account.   Business Plan Uptime SLA Program Benefits:  We guarantee that the service will have a quarterly Uptime percentage of 99.95%. That means GitHub's Essential Services will not be interrupted by an Outage affecting more than 50% of Active Users, for more than .05% of the quarter. If we don't meet our 99.95% quarterly Uptime guarantee, we may issue Service Credits to Customers.  How do we calculate Uptime?  Our Uptime calculation is based on the percentage of successful requests we serve through our web, API, and Git client interfaces.  What's excluded from our Uptime guarantee? Outages resulting from:  Scheduled Downtime Customer's acts, omissions, or misuse of the Services, including violations of the Terms of Service. Failures of your internet connectivity Factors outside our reasonable control, including Internet access related problems, force majeure events, and third party services or technology Your equipment, services, or other technology  What are Uptime Service Credits, how can I find out if I have them, and how can I redeem them?  If GitHub's quarterly Uptime percentage drops below our 99.95% Uptime guarantee, then Customer is entitled to receive 25 times the amount that was paid for the Outage time that exceeds the quarterly Uptime guarantee (\"Uptime Service Credit\"), which will be applied against the Customer's next bill. Uptime Service Credits are calculated at the end of each quarter, and may only be granted upon request. To find out about GitHub's Uptime percentage, you can request an Uptime report at the end of each quarter. In order to be granted an Uptime Service Credits, either an account Owner or Billing Manager must send in a written request, on Customer's behalf, within 30 days of the end of each quarter. Uptime Service Credits may not be saved. After being granted an Uptime Service Credit, it will be automatically applied to Customer's next bill. Written requests should be sent to GitHub Support.  Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability: GitHub's Status Page is not connected to this Uptime SLA and is not an accurate representation of GitHub's Uptime for the purposes of calculating Uptime Service Credits. Service Credits are limited to 30 days of paid service, per quarter. Service Credits are Customer's only remedy for any failure by GitHub to meet any Uptime obligations as identified in this Addendum.",

      "body": " Sometimes a commit will be viewable on GitHub, but will not exist in your local clone of the repository.  When you use git show to view a specific commit on the command line, you may get a fatal error. For example, you may receive a bad object error locally:  git show 1095ff3d0153115e75b7bca2c09e5136845b5592 fatal: bad object 1095ff3d0153115e75b7bca2c09e5136845b5592  However, when you view the commit on GitHub, you'll be able to see it without any problems: github.com/$account/$repository/commit/1095ff3d0153115e75b7bca2c09e5136845b5592 There are several possible explanations:  The local repository is out of date. The branch that contains the commit was deleted, so the commit is no longer referenced. Someone force pushed over the commit.   The local repository is out of date Your local repository may not have the commit yet. To get information from your remote repository to your local clone, use git fetch:  git fetch remote  This safely copies information from the remote repository to your local clone without making any changes to the files you have checked out. You can use git fetch upstream to get information from a repository you've forked, or git fetch origin to get information from a repository you've only cloned.  Tip: For more information, read about managing remotes and fetching data in the Pro Git book.   The branch that contained the commit was deleted If a collaborator on the repository has deleted the branch containing the commit or has force pushed over the branch, the missing commit may have been orphaned (i.e. it cannot be reached from any reference) and therefore will not be fetched into your local clone. Fortunately, if any collaborator has a local clone of the repository with the missing commit, they can push it back to GitHub. They need to make sure the commit is referenced by a local branch and then push it as a new branch to GitHub. Let's say that the person still has a local branch (call it B) that contains the commit. This might be tracking the branch that was force pushed or deleted and they simply haven't updated yet. To preserve the commit, they can push that local branch to a new branch (call it recover-B) on GitHub. For this example, let's assume they have a remote named upstream via which they have push access to github.com/$account/$repository. The other person runs:  git branch recover-B B # Create a new local branch referencing the commit git push upstream B:recover-B # Push local B to new upstream branch, creating new reference to commit  Now, you can run:  git fetch upstream recover-B # Fetch commit into your local repository.   Avoid force pushes Avoid force pushing to a repository unless absolutely necessary. This is especially true if more than one person can push to the repository.

      "body": "GitHub supports Subversion clients via the HTTPS protocol. We use a Subversion bridge to communicate svn commands to GitHub.  Supported Subversion features on GitHub  Checkout The first thing you'll want to do is a Subversion checkout. Since Git clones keep the working directory (where you edit files) separate from the repository data, there is only one branch in the working directory at a time. Subversion checkouts are different: they mix the repository data in the working directories, so there is a working directory for each branch and tag you've checked out. For repositories with many branches and tags, checking out everything can be a bandwidth burden, so you should start with a partial checkout.  On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository. Under the repository name, click Clone or download.  In the Clone with HTTPs section, click  to copy the clone URL for the repository.   Make an empty checkout of the repository:  svn co --depth empty https://github.com/user/repo Checked out revision 1. cd repo    Get the trunk branch. The Subversion bridge maps trunk to the Git HEAD branch (which is usually master).  svn up trunk A trunk A trunk/README.md A trunk/gizmo.rb Updated to revision 1.    Get an empty checkout of the branches directory. This is where all of the non-HEAD branches live, and where you'll be making feature branches.  svn up --depth empty branches Updated to revision 1.     Creating branches You can also create branches using the Subversion bridge to GitHub. From your svn client, make sure \"master\" is current by updating trunk:  svn up trunk At revision 1.  Next, you can use svn copy to create a new branch:  svn copy trunk branches/more_awesome A branches/more_awesome svn commit -m 'Added more_awesome topic branch' Adding branches/more_awesome Committed revision 2.  You can confirm that the new branch exists in the repository's branch dropdown:  You can also confirm the new branch via the command line:  git fetch From https://github.com/user/repo/ * [new branch] more_awesome -&gt; origin/more_awesome   Making commits to Subversion After you've added some features and fixed some bugs, you'll want to commit those changes to GitHub. This works just like the Subversion you're used to. Edit your files, and use svn commit to record your changes:  svn status M gizmo.rb svn commit -m 'Guard against known problems' Sending more_awesome/gizmo.rb Transmitting file data . Committed revision 3. svn status ? test svn add test A test A test/gizmo_test.rb svn commit -m 'Test coverage for problems' Adding more_awesome/test Adding more_awesome/test/gizmo_test.rb Transmitting file data . Committed revision 4.   Switching between branches To switch between branches, you'll probably want to start with a checkout of trunk:  svn co --depth empty https://github.com/user/repo/trunk  Then, you can switch to another branch:  svn switch https://github.com/user/repo/branches/more_awesome   Finding the Git commit SHA for a Subversion commit GitHub's Subversion server exposes the Git commit sha for each Subversion commit. To see the commit SHA, you should ask for the git-commit unversioned remote property.  svn propget git-commit --revprop -r HEAD https://github.com/user/repo 05fcc584ed53d7b0c92e116cb7e64d198b13c4e3  With this commit SHA, you can, for example, look up the corresponding Git commit on GitHub.

If the default parent repository isn't correct, you can change both the parent repository and the branch with the drop-down lists. You can also swap your head and base branches with the drop-down lists to establish diffs between reference points. References here must be branch names in your GitHub repository.

Tips:  Using the compare view, you can set up comparisons across any timeframe. Project maintainers can add a pull request template for a repository. Templates include prompts for information the project's maintainers prefer to see in the body of a pull request.    Creating the pull request  On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.

      "url": "/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice",
      "body": "This guide describes the information that GitHub needs in order to process a DMCA takedown request. If you have more general questions about what the DMCA is or how GitHub processes DMCA takedown requests, please review our DMCA Takedown Policy. Due to the type of content GitHub hosts (mostly software code) and the way that content is managed (with Git), we need complaints to be as specific as possible. These guidelines are designed to make the processing of alleged infringement notices as straightforward as possible. Our form of notice set forth below is consistent with the form suggested by the DMCA statute, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office's official website: http://www.copyright.gov. As with all legal matters, it is always best to consult with a professional about your specific questions or situation. We strongly encourage you to do so before taking any action that might impact your rights. This guide isn't legal advice and shouldn't be taken as such.  Before You Start Tell the Truth. The DMCA requires that you swear to the facts in your copyright complaint under penalty of perjury. It is a federal crime to intentionally lie in a sworn declaration. (See U.S. Code, Title 18, Section 1621.) Submitting false information could also result in civil liability—that is, you could get sued for money damages. Investigate. Millions of users and organizations pour their hearts and souls into the projects they create and contribute to on GitHub. Filing a DMCA complaint against such a project is a serious legal allegation that carries real consequences for real people. Because of that, we ask that you conduct a thorough investigation and consult with an attorney before submitting a takedown to make sure that the use isn't actually permissible. Ask Nicely First. A great first step before sending us a takedown notice is to try contacting the user directly. They may have listed contact information on their public profile page or in the repository's README, or you could get in touch by opening an issue or pull request on the repository. This is not strictly required, but it is classy. Code Is Different From Other Creative Content. GitHub is built for collaboration on software code. This makes identifying a valid copyright infringement more complicated than it might otherwise be for, say, photos, music, or videos. For instance:  A repository may include bits and pieces of code from many different people, but only one file or even a sub-routine within a file infringes your copyrights. Code mixes functionality with creative expression, but copyright only protects the expressive elements. There are often licenses to consider. Just because a piece of code has a copyright notice does not necessarily mean that it is infringing. It is possible that the code is being used in accordance with an open-source license. A particular use may be fair-use if it only uses a small amount of copyrighted content, uses that content in a transformative way, uses it for educational purposes, or some combination of the above. Because code naturally lends itself to such uses, each use case is different and must be considered separately. Code may be alleged to infringe, not because it is a direct copy, but because it is used to circumvent access controls.  This list isn't exhaustive, which is why speaking to a legal professional about your proposed complaint is doubly important when dealing with code. No Bots. You should have a trained professional evaluate the facts of every takedown notice you send. If you are outsourcing your efforts to a third party, make sure you know how they operate, and make sure they are not using automated bots to submit complaints in bulk. These complaints are often invalid and processing them results in needlessly taking down projects! You May Receive a Counter Notice. Any user affected by your takedown notice may decide to submit a counter notice. If they do, we will re-enable their content within 10-14 days unless you notify us that you have initiated a legal action seeking to restrain the user from engaging in infringing activity relating to the content on GitHub. Your Complaint Will Be Published. As noted in our DMCA Takedown Policy, after redacting personal information, we publish all complete and actionable takedown notices at https://github.com/github/dmca. GitHub Isn't The Judge. GitHub exercises little discretion in the process other than determining whether the notices meet the minimum requirements of the DMCA. It is up to the parties (and their lawyers) to evaluate the merit of their claims, bearing in mind that notices must be made under penalty of perjury.  Your Complaint Must ...  Include the following statement: \"I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.\" We won't refuse to process an otherwise complete complaint if you don't include this statement. But we'll know that you haven't read these guidelines and may ask you to go back and do so. Identify the copyrighted work you believe has been infringed. This information is important because it helps the affected user evaluate your claim and give them the ability to compare your work to theirs. The specificity of your identification will depend on the nature of the work you believe has been infringed. If you have published your work, you might be able to just link back to a web page where it lives. If it is proprietary and not published, you might describe it and explain that it is proprietary. If you have registered it with the Copyright Office, you should include the registration number. If you are alleging that the hosted content is a direct, literal copy of your work, you can also just explain that fact. Identify the material that you allege is infringing the copyrighted work listed in item #2, above. It is important to be as specific as possible in your identification. This identification needs to be reasonably sufficient to permit GitHub to locate the material. At a minimum, this means that you should include the URL to the material allegedly infringing your copyright. If you allege that less than a whole repository infringes, identify the specific file(s) or line numbers within a file that you allege infringe. If you allege that all of the content at a URL infringes, please be explicit about that as well. Finally, please note that GitHub will not automatically disable forks when disabling a parent repository. If you have investigated and analyzed the forks of a repository and believe that they are also infringing, please explicitly identify each allegedly infringing fork. Please also confirm that you have investigated each individual case and that your sworn statements apply to each identified fork. Explain what the affected user would need to do in order to remedy the infringement. Again, specificity is important. When we pass your complaint along to the user, this will tell them what they need to do in order to avoid having the rest of their content disabled. Does the user just need to add a statement of attribution? Do they need to delete certain lines within their code, or entire files? Of course, we understand that in some cases, all of a user's content may be alleged to infringe and there's nothing they could do short of deleting it all. If that's the case, please make that clear as well. Provide your contact information. Include your email address, name, telephone number and physical address. Provide contact information, if you know it, for the alleged infringer. Usually this will be satisfied by providing the GitHub username associated with the allegedly infringing content. But there may be cases where you have additional knowledge about the alleged infringer. If so, please share that information with us. Include the following statement: \"I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.\" Also include the following statement: \"I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.\" Include your physical or electronic signature.   How to Submit Your Complaint The fastest way to get a response is to enter your information and answer all the questions on our Copyright claims form. You can also send an email notification to copyright@github.com. You may include an attachment if you like, but please also include a plain-text version of your letter in the body of your message. If you must send your notice by physical mail, you can do that too, but it will take substantially longer for us to receive and respond to it. Notices we receive via plain-text email have a much faster turnaround than PDF attachments or physical mail. If you still wish to mail us your notice, our physical address is: GitHub, Inc Attn: DMCA Agent 88 Colin P Kelly Jr St San Francisco, CA. 94107 ",

Converting a user into an organization  You can convert your user account into an organization. This allows more granular permissions for repositories that belong to the organization.

      "body": "Commits and pull requests that include prose documents have the ability to represent those documents with source and rendered views. The source view shows the raw text that has been typed, while the rendered view shows how that text would look once it's rendered on GitHub. For example, this might be the difference between showing **bold** in Markdown, and bold in the rendered view. Prose rendering is supported for rendered documents supported by github/markup:  Markdown AsciiDoc Textile ReStructuredText Rdoc Org Creole MediaWiki Pod   When you click the paper icon on the right, you'll also see the changes made to that document as part of a commit.   Visualizing attribute changes We provide a tooltip describing changes to attributes that, unlike words, would not otherwise be visible in the rendered document. For example, if a link URL changes from one website to another, we'd show a tooltip like this:   Commenting on changes Commit comments can only be added to files within the source view, on a line-by-line basis.  Linking to headers As with other rendered prose documents, hovering over a header in your document creates a link icon. You can link readers of your rendered prose diff to specific sections.  Viewing complex diffs Some pull requests involve a large number of changes with large, complex documents. When the changes take too long to analyze, GitHub can't always produce a rendered view of the changes; you'll see a message similar to this when you click the rendered button:  You can still use the source view to analyze and comment on changes.  Viewing HTML elements We don't directly support rendered views of commits to HTML documents. Some formats, such as Markdown, let you embed arbitrary HTML in a document. When these documents are shown on GitHub, some of that embedded HTML can be shown in a preview, while some (like an embedded YouTube video) cannot. In general, rendered views of changes to a document containing embedded HTML will show changes to the elements that are supported in GitHub's view of the document. Changes to documents containing embedded HTML should always be reviewed in both the rendered and source views for completeness.",

      "category_url": "/categories/search",
      "url": "/articles/searching-issues",
      "body": " To search for issues and pull requests, use the following search qualifiers in any combination.   Tips:  There's a list of search syntaxes you can add to any search qualifier to further improve your results. Use quotations around your multi-word search terms. For example, if you want to search for issues with the label \"In progress,\" you'd search for label:\"in progress\". Search is not case sensitive.    Search issues or pull requests By default, searching issues will return both issues and pull requests. However, you can use the type qualifier to restrict search results to just issues or pull requests.  cat type:pr Matches pull requests with the word cat. github commenter:defunkt type:issue Matches issues that contain the word github, and have a comment by @defunkt.   Scope the search fields The in qualifier limits what fields are searched. With this qualifier you can restrict the search to just the title, body, comments, or any combination of these. Without the qualifier, the title, body, and comments are searched.  warning in:title Matches issues with warning in their title. error in:title,body Matches issues with error in their title or body. shipit in:comments Matches issues mentioning  in their comments.   Search inside public and private repositories If you're searching across all of GitHub, it can be helpful to filter your results based on whether the repository is public or private. You can do this with is:private and is:public.  is:public Lists all the issues and pull requests in all public repositories. is:private cupcake Searches for issues and pull requests that talk about cupcakes in all the private repositories that you have access to.   Search by the author of an issue or pull request The author qualifier finds issues created by a certain user. For example:  cool author:gjtorikian Matches issues with the word cool, created by @gjtorikian. bootstrap in:body author:mdo Matches issues written by @mdo that contain the word bootstrap in the body.   Search by the assignee of an issue or pull request Much like with author, the assignee qualifier finds issues that are assigned to a certain user. For example:  assignee:vmg Matches issues assigned to @vmg. assignee:fjakobs repo:ajaxorg/ace Matches issues assigned to @fjakobs within the @ajaxorg/ace repository.   Search by a mentioned user within an issue or pull request The mentions qualifier finds issues that mention a certain user. For example:  resque mentions:defunkt Matches issues with the word \"resque\" that mention @defunkt anywhere. mentions:azakus assignee:arv Matches issues that mention @azakus but are assigned to @arv.   Search by a commenter within an issue or pull request The commenter qualifier finds issues that contain a comment from a certain user. For example:  commenter:lennartcl Matches issues @lennartcl commented on. github commenter:defunkt user:github Matches issues in repositories owned by GitHub, that contain the word github, and have a comment by @defunkt.   Search by a user that's involved within an issue or pull request You can use the involves qualifier for finding issues that in some way involve a certain user. The involves qualifier is just a logical OR between the author, assignee, mentions and commenter qualifiers for the same user. In other words, this qualifier finds issues that were either created by a certain user, assigned to that user, mention that user, or were commented on by that user.  involves:defunkt involves:jlord Matches issues either @defunkt or @jlord are involved in. NOT bootstrap in:body involves:mdo Matches issues @mdo is involved in that do not contain the word bootstrap in the body.   Search by a team that's mentioned within an issue or pull request For organizations and teams you belong to, you can use the team qualifier to find issues or pull requests that @mention a certain team within that organization. Replace these sample names with your organization and team name to perform a search.  team:jekyll/owners Matches issues where the `@jekyll/owners` team is mentioned. team:myorg/ops is:open is:pr Matches open pull requests where the `@myorg/ops` team is mentioned.   Search based on whether an issue or pull request is open You can choose to filter issues based on whether they're open or closed based on the state qualifier. For example:  terrible state:closed in:body Matches closed issues with the word terrible in the body (how rude). ie state:open mentions:fat Matches open issues that mention @fat with the word ie.   Search by the labels on an issue You can narrow your results by labels, using the label qualifier. Since issues can have multiple labels, you can list a separate qualifier for each issue. For example:  cat label:bug Matches issues with the word cat that are also labelled with bug. label:bug label:resolved Matches issues with the labels bug and resolved. broken in:body -label:bug label:priority Matches issues with the word \"broken\" in the body, that lack the label \"bug\", but *do* have the label \"priority\".   Search by milestone on an issue or pull request The milestone qualifier finds issues or pull requests that are a part of a milestone within a repository. For example:  milestone:\"overhaul\"  Matches issues and pull requests that are a part of the \"overhaul\" milestone.   Search by project board You can use the project qualifier to find issues that are associated with a specific project board in a repository or organization. You must search project boards by the project board number. You can find the project board number at the end of a project board's URL.  project:github/57 Matches issues owned by GitHub that are associated with the organization's project board 57. project:github/linguist/1 Matches issues owned by GitHub that are associated with project board 1 in the linguist repository.   Search by missing metadata on an issue or pull request You can scope issues and pull requests to those missing certain metadata using the no qualifier. That metadata includes:  Labels Milestones Assignees Projects   priority no:label Matches issues and pull requests with the word \"priority\" that also don't have any labels. sprint no:milestone type:issue Matches issues not associated with a milestone containing the word sprint. important no:assignee language:java type:issue Matches issues not associated with an assignee, containing the word \"important,\" and in Java repositories. build no:project Matches issues not associated with a project board, containing the word \"build.\"   Search by the main language of a repository You can choose to search for issues within repositories that match a certain language with the language qualifiers. For example:  language:ruby state:open Matches open issues that are in Ruby repositories. mentions:holman language:bash Matches issues that mention @holman within repositories containing Bash code.   Search based on the state of an issue or pull request The is qualifier is unique, in that it provides a more human syntax to accomplish several of the above queries. For example, you can use the is qualifier to determine if:  An item is open or closed. An item is merged or unmerged. An item is a pr or an issue.  Here are some sample queries demonstrating these properties:  bugfix is:pr is:unmerged Matches pull requests that are unmerged with the word bugfix in them. performance is:open is:issue Matches open issues with the word performance in them. error is:closed Matches closed issues and pull requests with the word error in them.   Search based on commit status You can filter pull requests based on the status of the commits. This is especially useful if you are using the Status API or a CI service.  language:go status:pending Matches pull requests opened into Go repositories where the status is pending. created:2015-05-01..2015-05-30 status:failure Matches pull requests opened on May 2015 with a failed status. is:open status:success finally in:body Matches open pull requests with the word \"finally\" in the body with a successful status.   Search based on branch names You can filter pull requests based on the branch they came from (the \"head\" branch) or the branch they are merging into (the \"base\" branch).  head:change is:closed is:unmerged Matches pull requests opened from branch names containing the word `change` that are closed . base:gh-pages Matches pull requests that are being merged into the `gh-pages` branch.   Search based on when an issue or pull request was created or last updated You can filter issues based on times of creation, or when they were last updated. For issue creation, you can use the created qualifier; to find out when an issue was last updated, you'll want to use the updated qualifier. Both take a date as a parameter. Date formatting must follow the ISO8601 standard, which is YYYY-MM-DD--that's year-month-day. You may also add some optional time information, formatted as THH:MM:SS+07:00--that's hour-minutes-seconds (HH:MM:SS), followed by a UTC offset (+07:00) Dates support greater than, less than, and range qualifiers. For example:  language:c# created:&lt;2011-01-01 state:open Matches open issues that were created before 2011 in repositories written in C#. weird in:body updated:&gt;=2013-02-01 Matches issues with the word weird in the body that were updated after February 2013. author:puzrin created:2012-11-01..2012-12-01 Matches issues created by @puzrin created between November and December of 2012.   Search based on when a pull request was merged You can filter pull requests based on when they were merged, using the merged qualifier. This qualifier takes a date as its parameter. Date formatting must follow the ISO8601 standard, which is YYYY-MM-DD--that's year-month-day. You may also add some optional time information, formatted as THH:MM:SS+07:00--that's hour-minutes-seconds (HH:MM:SS), followed by a UTC offset (+07:00) Dates support greater than, less than, and range qualifiers. For example:  language:javascript merged:&lt;2011-01-01  Matches pull requests in JavaScript repositories that were merged before 2011. fast in:title language:ruby merged:&gt;=2014-05-01 Matches pull requests in Ruby with the word \"fast\" in the title that were merged after May 2014.   Search based on when an issue or pull request was closed You can filter issues and pull requests based on when they were closed, using the closed qualifier. This qualifier takes a date as its parameter. Date formatting must follow the ISO8601 standard, which is YYYY-MM-DD--that's year-month-day. You may also add some optional time information, formatted as THH:MM:SS+07:00--that's hour-minutes-seconds (HH:MM:SS), followed by a UTC offset (+07:00) Dates support greater than, less than, and range qualifiers. For example:  silly in:body closed:&lt;2012-10-01 Matches issues and pull requests with the word \"silly\" in the body that were closed before October 2012. language:swift closed:&gt;2014-06-11 Matches issues and pull requests in Swift that were closed after June 11, 2014.   Search by the number of comments an issue or pull request has You can choose to qualify matched labels based on comments by adding a comments range. For example:  state:closed comments:&gt;100 Matches closed issues with more than 100 comments. comments:500..1000 Matches issues with comments ranging from 500 to 1,000.   Search within a user's or organization's repositories To grab a list of issues from all repositories owned by a certain user or organization, you can use the user syntax. For getting a list of issues from a specific repository, you can use the repo syntax. For example:  user:defunkt ubuntu Matches issues with the word ubuntu from repositories owned by @defunkt. repo:mozilla/shumway created:&lt;2012-03-01 Matches issues from @mozilla's shumway project that were created before March 2012.   Search by the commit SHAs within a pull request If you know the specific SHA hash of a commit, you can use it to search for pull requests that contain that SHA. Note that the SHA syntax must be at least seven characters. For example:  e1109ab Matches pull requests with a commit SHA that starts with `e1109ab`. 0eff326d6213c is:merged Matches merged pull requests with a commit SHA that starts with `0eff326d6213c`.   Search pull requests by review status You can filter pull requests based on their review status (none, required, approved, changes requested, or required), by reviewer, and by requested reviewer. For example:  type:pr review:none Matches pull requests that have not been reviewed. type:pr review:required Matches pull requests that require a review before they can be merged. type:pr review:approved Matches pull requests that a reviewer has approved. type:pr review:changes_requested Matches pull requests in which a reviewer has asked for changes. type:pr reviewed-by:gjtorikian Matches pull requests reviewed by a particular person. type:pr review-requested:benbalter Matches pull requests a particular person has been asked to review. Requested reviewers are no longer listed in the search results after they review a pull request.   Sort the results With any of the qualifiers above, you can also choose to sort on these properties:  Number of comments Date created Date of last update  These can be in ascending or descending order.",

If a team's access to a private repository is revoked or a team with access to a private repository is deleted, and team members do not have access to the repository through another team, private forks of the repository will be deleted.   Deleting a private repository When you delete a private repository, all of its private forks are also deleted.  Deleting a public repository When you delete a public repository, one of the existing public forks is chosen to be the new parent repository. All other repositories are forked off of this new parent and subsequent pull requests go to this new parent.  Private forks and permissions Private forks inherit the permissions structure of the upstream or parent repository. For example, if the upstream repository is private and gives read/write access to a team, then the same team will have read/write access to any forks of the private upstream repository. This helps owners of private repositories maintain control over their code.  Changing a public repository to a private repository If a public repository is made private, its public forks are split off into a new network. As with deleting a public repository, one of the existing public forks is chosen to be the new parent repository and all other repositories are forked off of this new parent. Subsequent pull requests go to this new parent. In other words, a public repository's forks will remain public in their own separate repository network even after the parent repository is made private. This allows the fork owners to continue to work and collaborate without interruption. If public forks were not moved into a separate network in this way, the owners of those forks would need to get the appropriate access permissions to pull changes from and submit pull requests to the (now private) parent repository—even though they didn't need those permissions before.  Deleting the private repository If a public repository is made private and then deleted, its public forks will continue to exist in a separate network.  Changing a private repository to a public repository If a private repository is made public, each of its private forks is turned into a standalone private repository and becomes the parent of its own new repository network. Private forks are never automatically made public because they could contain sensitive commits that shouldn't be exposed publicly. If you own a private fork that has been converted into a standalone private repository and you have the free plan, the repository will be locked. To access the repository again, you can upgrade to a paid plan or make the repository public.

      "body": "When you click the default Merge pull request option on a pull request on GitHub, all commits from the feature branch are added to the base branch in a merge commit. The pull request is merged using the --no-ff option. To merge pull requests, you must have write permissions in the repository.   Squash and merge your pull request commits When you select the Squash and merge option on a pull request on GitHub, the pull request's commits are squashed into a single commit. Instead of seeing all of a contributor's individual commits from a topic branch, the commits are combined into one commit and merged into the default branch. Pull requests with squashed commits are merged using the fast-forward option. To squash and merge pull requests, you must have write permissions in the repository, and the repository must allow squash merging.  You can use squash and merge to create a more streamlined Git history in your repository. Work-in-progress commits are helpful when working on a feature branch, but they aren’t necessarily important to retain in the Git history. If you squash these commits into one commit while merging to the default branch, you can retain the original changes with a clear Git history.  Rebase and merge your pull request commits When you select the Rebase and merge option on a pull request on GitHub, all commits from the topic branch (or head branch) are added onto the base branch individually without a merge commit. Pull requests with rebased commits are merged using the fast-forward option. To rebase and merge pull requests, you must have write permissions in the repository, and the repository must allow rebase merging. The rebase and merge behavior on GitHub deviates slightly from git rebase. Rebase and merge on GitHub will always update the committer information and create new commit SHAs, whereas git rebase outside of GitHub does not change the committer information when the rebase happens on top of an ancestor commit. For more information about git rebase, see the \"Git rebase\" chapter from the Pro Git book. For a visual representation of git rebase, see The \"Git Branching - Rebasing\" chapter from the Pro Git book. You aren't able to automatically rebase and merge on GitHub when:  The pull request has merge conflicts. Rebasing the commits from the base branch into the head branch runs into conflicts. Rebasing the commits is considered \"unsafe,\" such as when a rebase is possible without merge conflicts but would produce a different result than a merge would.  If you still want to rebase the commits but can't rebase and merge automatically on GitHub you must:  Rebase the topic branch (or head branch) onto the base branch locally on the command line  Resolve any merge conflicts on the command line. Force-push the rebased commits to the pull request's topic branch (or remote head branch).  Anyone with write permissions in the repository, can then merge the changes using the rebase and merge button on GitHub.  Further reading  \"About pull requests\" \"Addressing merge conflicts\" ",

      "body": "Are you a law enforcement officer conducting an investigation that may involve user content hosted on GitHub? Or maybe you're a privacy-conscious person who would like to know what information we share with law enforcement and under what circumstances. Either way, you're on the right page. In these guidelines, we provide a little background about what GitHub is, the types of data we have, and the conditions under which we will disclose private user information. Before we get into the details, however, here are a few important details you may want to know:  We will notify affected users about any requests for their account information, unless prohibited from doing so by law or court order. We will not disclose location-tracking data, such as IP address logs, without a valid court order or search warrant. We will not disclose any private user content, including the contents of private repositories, without a valid search warrant.   About these guidelines Our users trust us with their software projects and code—often some of their most valuable business or personal assets. Maintaining that trust is essential to us, which means keeping user data safe, secure, and private. While the overwhelming majority of our users use GitHub's services to create new businesses, build new technologies, and for the general betterment of humankind, we recognize that with millions of users spread all over the world, there are bound to be a few bad apples in the bunch. In those cases, we want to help law enforcement serve their legitimate interest in protecting the public. By providing guidelines for law enforcement personnel, we hope to strike a balance between the often competing interests of user privacy and justice. We hope these guidelines will help to set expectations on both sides, as well as to add transparency to GitHub's internal processes. Our users should know that we value their private information and that we do what we can to protect it. At a minimum, this means only releasing data to third-parties when the appropriate legal requirements have been satisfied. By the same token, we also hope to educate law enforcement professionals about GitHub's systems so that they can more efficiently tailor their data requests and target just that information needed to conduct their investigation.  GitHub terminology Before asking us to disclose data, it may be useful to understand how our system is implemented. GitHub hosts millions of data repositories using the Git version control system. Repositories on GitHub—which may be public or private—are most commonly used for software development projects, but are also often used to work on content of all kinds.  Users — Users are represented in our system as personal GitHub accounts. Each user has a personal profile, and can own multiple repositories. Users can create or be invited to join organizations or to collaborate on another user's repository. Collaborators — A collaborator is a user with read and write access to a repository who has been invited to contribute by the repository owner. Organizations — Organizations are a group of two or more users that typically mirror real-world organizations, such as businesses or projects. They are administered by users and can contain both repositories and teams of users. Repositories — A repository is one of the most basic GitHub elements. They may be easiest to imagine as a project's folder. A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and, at its administrators' discretion, may be publicly viewable or not. Pages — GitHub Pages are public webpages freely hosted by GitHub that users can easily publish through code stored in their repositories. If a user or organization has a GitHub Page, it can usually be found at a URL such as https://username.github.io or they may have the webpage mapped to their own custom domain name. Gists — Gists are snippets of source code or other text that users can use to store ideas or share with friends. Like regular GitHub repositories, Gists are created with Git, so they are automatically versioned, forkable and downloadable. Gists can either be public or secret (accessible only through a known URL). Public Gists cannot be converted into secret Gists.   User data on GitHub.com Here is a non-exhaustive list of the kinds of data we maintain about users and projects on GitHub.    Public account data — There is a variety of information publicly available on GitHub about users and their repositories. User profiles can be found at a URL such as https://github.com/username. User profiles display information about when the user created their account as well their public activity on GitHub.com and social interactions. Public user profiles can also include additional information that a user may have chosen to share publicly. All user public profiles display:  Username The repositories that the user has starred The other GitHub users the user follows The users that follow them  Optionally, a user may also choose to share the following information publicly:  Their real name An avatar An affiliated company Their location A public email address Their personal web page Organizations to which the user is a member (depending on either the organizations' or the users' preferences)     Private account data — GitHub also collects and maintains certain private information about users as outlined in our Privacy Policy. This may include:  Private email addresses Payment details Security access logs Data about interactions with private repositories  To get a sense of the type of private account information that GitHub collects, you can visit your personal dashboard and browse through the sections in the left-hand menubar.    Public repository data — GitHub is home to millions of public, open-source software projects. You can browse almost any public repository (for example, the Atom Project) to get a sense for the information that GitHub collects and maintains about repositories. This can include:  The code itself Previous versions of the code Stable release versions of the project Information about collaborators, contributors and repository members Logs of Git operations such as commits, branching, pushing, pulling, forking and cloning Conversations related to Git operations such as comments on pull requests or commits Project documentation such as Issues and Wiki pages Statistics and graphs showing contributions to the project and the network of contributors    Private repository data — GitHub collects and maintains the same type of data for private repositories that can be seen for public repositories, except only specifically invited users may access private repository data.  Other data — Additionally, GitHub collects analytics data such as page visits and information occasionally volunteered by our users (such as communications with our support team, survey information and/or site registrations).   We will notify any affected account owners It is our policy to notify users about any pending requests regarding their accounts or repositories, unless we are prohibited by law or court order from doing so, or in rare, exigent circumstances. Before disclosing user information, we will make a reasonable effort to notify any affected account owner(s) by sending a message to their verified email address providing them with a copy of the subpoena, court order or warrant so that they can have an opportunity to challenge the legal process if they wish.  Disclosure of non-public information It is our policy to disclose non-public user information in connection with a civil or criminal investigation only with user consent or upon receipt of a valid subpoena, civil investigative demand, court order, search warrant, or other similar valid legal process. GitHub reserves the right to object to any requests for non-public information. Where GitHub agrees to produce non-public information in response to a lawful request, we will conduct a reasonable search for the requested information. Here are the kinds of information we will agree to produce, depending on the kind of legal process we are served with:   With user consent — GitHub will provide private account information, if requested, directly to the user (or an owner, in the case of an organization account), or to a designated third party with the user's written consent once GitHub is satisfied that the user has verified his or her identity.   With a subpoena — If served with a valid subpoena, civil investigative demand, or similar legal process issued in connection with an official criminal or civil investigation, we can provide certain non-public account information, which may include:  Name(s) associated with the account Email address(es) associated with the account Billing information Registration date and termination date IP address, date, and time at the time of account registration IP address(es) used to access the account at a specified time or event relevant to the investigation  Please note that the information available will vary from case to case. Some of the information is optional for users to provide. In other cases, we might not have collected or retained the information.    With a court order or a search warrant — We will not disclose account access logs unless compelled to do so by either (i) a court order issued under 18 U.S.C. Section 2703(d), upon a showing of specific and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the information sought is relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation; or (ii) a search warrant issued under the procedures described in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure or equivalent state warrant procedures, upon a showing of probable cause. Account access logs may include:  Any logs which would reveal a user's movements over a period of time Account or private repository settings (for example, which users have certain permissions, etc.) User- or IP-specific analytic data such as browsing history Security access logs other than account creation or for a specific time and date     Only with a search warrant — We will not disclose the private contents of any user account unless compelled to do so under a search warrant issued under the procedures described in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure or equivalent state warrant procedures upon a showing of probable cause. Private user account contents may include:  Contents of secret Gists Source code or other content in private repositories Contribution and collaboration records for private repositories Communications or documentation (such as Issues or Wikis) in private repositories     Cost reimbursement We reserve the right to seek reimbursement for administrative costs associated with responding to requests for information, as allowed by law.  Data preservation We will take steps to preserve account records for up to 90 days upon formal request from U.S. law enforcement in connection with official criminal investigations, and pending the issuance of a court order or other process.

      "body": " Changes to your organization's previous Owners team Instead of giving the highest level of organization privileges to members of the Owners team, individuals can now be directly given owner privileges for the organization. All members of your previous Owners team already have this permission, so we recommend that you rename or delete the Owners team according to your needs. Additionally, owners can now promote organization members to team maintainers, who can manage the team's members and settings.  Expanded team settings Teams can be visible or secret:   Visible teams can be viewed and @mentioned by every organization member, even if they aren't organization owners or members of those teams. If you make every team in your organization visible, your members will be able to use team @mentions across your organization.  Secret teams are only visible to the people on the team and people with owner permissions. They're great for hiding teams with sensitive names or team members, such as those used for working with external partners or clients.   Tip: Because we've expanded the abilities of regular organization members, we encourage you to reduce the number of people with owner permissions.   Additional security for repositories You can now set a default repository access level for all members. If you run a more open organization, this allows you to give every member access to every repository without making them all owners or creating a giant catch-all team. Organization owners and users with admin access to a repository can make anyone with a GitHub account an outside collaborator on individual repositories without making them a member of your organization. This is great for managing contractors, interns, or temporary employees. By default, all organization members can create repositories for the organization. If you choose, you can restrict repository creation permissions to organization owners only.",

      "body": " To search for users, use the following search qualifiers in any combination.   Tips:  There's a list of search syntaxes you can add to any search qualifier to further improve your results. Use quotations around your multi-word search terms. For example, if you want to search for issues with the label \"In progress,\" you'd search for label:\"in progress\". Search is not case sensitive.    Search for users or organizations By default, searching users will return both personal and organizations. However, you can use the type qualifier to restrict search results to personal accounts or organizations only.  tom in:email type:org Matches organizations with the word tom in their email. mike in:name created:&lt;2011-01-01 type:user Matches personal accounts named mike that were created before 2011.   Scope the search fields The in qualifier limits what fields are searched. With this qualifier you can restrict the search to the username, public email, full name, or any combination of these. Without the qualifier, only the username and email address are searched.  tom in:email Matches users with the word tom in their email. For privacy reasons, you cannot search by domain name. kenya in:login Matches users with the word kenya in their username. bolton in:fullname Matches users whose real name has the word Bolton.   Search based on the number of repositories a user has The repos qualifier filters users based on the number of repositories they have. For example:  repos:&gt;9000 Matches users whose repository count is over 9,000. bert repos:10..30 Matches users with the word \"bert\" in their username or real name who own 10 to 30 repositories.   Search based on the location where a user resides You can choose to filter users by the location indicated in their profile. For example:  repos:1 location:iceland Matches users with exactly one repository that live in Iceland.   Search based on the languages of a user's repositories You can search for users that own repositories that match a certain language via the language qualifiers. For example:  language:javascript location:russia Matches users in Russia with a majority of their repositories written in JavaScript. jenny language:javascript in:fullname Matches users with JavaScript repositories whose full name contains the word Jenny.   Search based on when a user joined GitHub You can filter users based on when they joined with the created qualifier. This takes a date as its parameter. Date formatting must follow the ISO8601 standard, which is YYYY-MM-DD--that's year-month-day. You may also add some optional time information, formatted as THH:MM:SS+07:00--that's hour-minutes-seconds (HH:MM:SS), followed by a UTC offset (+07:00) Dates support greater than, less than, and range qualifiers. For example:  created:&lt;2011-01-01 Matches users that joined before 2011. created:&gt;=2013-05-11 Matches users that joined at or after May 11th, 2013. created:2013-03-06 location:london Matches users that joined on March 6th, 2013, who list their location as London. created:2010-01-01..2011-01-01 john in:login Matches users that joined between 2010 and 2011 with the word \"john\" in their username.   Search based on the number of followers a user has You can filter users based on the number of followers that they have with the followers qualifier. For example:  followers:&gt;=1000 Matches users with 1,000 or more followers. sparkle followers:1..10 Matches users with between 1 and 10 followers, with the word sparkle in their name.   Sort the results With any of the qualifiers above, you can also choose to sort on these properties:  Number of followers Number of repositories When they joined GitHub  These can be in ascending or descending order.",

Changed commit SHAs may affect open pull requests in your repository. We recommend merging or closing all open pull requests before removing files from your repository. You can remove the file from the latest commit with git rm. For information on removing a file that was added with the latest commit, see \"Removing files from a repository's history.\"  Warning: Once you have pushed a commit to GitHub, you should consider any data it contains to be compromised. If you committed a password, change it! If you committed a key, generate a new one. This article tells you how to make commits with sensitive data unreachable from any branches or tags in your GitHub repository. However, it's important to note that those commits may still be accessible in any clones or forks of your repository, directly via their SHA-1 hashes in cached views on GitHub, and through any pull requests that reference them. You can't do anything about existing clones or forks of your repository, but you can permanently remove all of your repository's cached views and pull requests on GitHub by contacting GitHub Support.   Purging a file from your repository's history  Using the BFG The BFG Repo-Cleaner is a faster, simpler alternative to git filter-branch for removing unwanted data. For example, to remove your file with sensitive data and leave your latest commit untouched), run:  bfg --delete-files YOUR-FILE-WITH-SENSITIVE-DATA  To replace all text listed in passwords.txt wherever it can be found in your repository's history, run:  bfg --replace-text passwords.txt  See the BFG Repo-Cleaner's documentation for full usage and download instructions.  Using filter-branch  Warning: If you run git filter-branch after stashing changes, you won't be able to retrieve your changes with other stash commands. Before running git filter-branch, we recommend unstashing any changes you've made. To unstash the last set of changes you've stashed, run git stash show -p | git apply -R. For more information, see Git Tools Stashing.  To illustrate how git filter-branch works, we'll show you how to remove your file with sensitive data from the history of your repository and add it to .gitignore to ensure that it is not accidentally re-committed.   If you don't already have a local copy of your repository with sensitive data in its history, clone the repository to your local computer.  git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/YOUR-FILE-PATH/YOUR-REPOSITORY/.git/ remote: Counting objects: 1301, done. remote: Compressing objects: 100% (769/769), done. remote: Total 1301 (delta 724), reused 910 (delta 522) Receiving objects: 100% (1301/1301), 164.39 KiB, done. Resolving deltas: 100% (724/724), done.    Navigate into the repository's working directory.  cd YOUR-REPOSITORY    Run the following command, replacing PATH-TO-YOUR-FILE-WITH-SENSITIVE-DATA with the path to the file you want to remove, not just its filename. These arguments will:  Force Git to process, but not check out, the entire history of every branch and tag Remove the specified file, as well as any empty commits generated as a result  Overwrite your existing tags  $ git filter-branch --force --index-filter \\ 'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch PATH-TO-YOUR-FILE-WITH-SENSITIVE-DATA' \\ --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all &gt; Rewrite 48dc599c80e20527ed902928085e7861e6b3cbe6 (266/266) &gt; Ref 'refs/heads/master' was rewritten     Note: If the file with sensitive data used to exist at any other paths (because it was moved or renamed), you must run this command on those paths, as well.    Add your file with sensitive data to .gitignore to ensure that you don't accidentally commit it again.  $ echo \"YOUR-FILE-WITH-SENSITIVE-DATA\" &gt;&gt; .gitignore $ git add .gitignore $ git commit -m \"Add YOUR-FILE-WITH-SENSITIVE-DATA to .gitignore\" &gt; [master 051452f] Add YOUR-FILE-WITH-SENSITIVE-DATA to .gitignore &gt; 1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)   Double-check that you've removed everything you wanted to from your repository's history, and that all of your branches are checked out.  Once you're happy with the state of your repository, force-push your local changes to overwrite your GitHub repository, as well as all the branches you've pushed up:  git push origin --force --all Counting objects: 1074, done. Delta compression using 2 threads. Compressing objects: 100% (677/677), done. Writing objects: 100% (1058/1058), 148.85 KiB, done. Total 1058 (delta 590), reused 602 (delta 378) To https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY.git  + 48dc599...051452f master -&gt; master (forced update)    In order to remove the sensitive file from your tagged releases, you'll also need to force-push against your Git tags:  git push origin --force --tags Counting objects: 321, done. Delta compression using up to 8 threads. Compressing objects: 100% (166/166), done. Writing objects: 100% (321/321), 331.74 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done. Total 321 (delta 124), reused 269 (delta 108) To https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY.git  + 48dc599...051452f master -&gt; master (forced update)   Tell your collaborators to rebase, not merge, any branches they created off of your old (tainted) repository history. One merge commit could reintroduce some or all of the tainted history that you just went to the trouble of purging.  After some time has passed and you're confident that git filter-branch had no unintended side effects, you can force all objects in your local repository to be dereferenced and garbage collected with the following commands (using Git 1.8.5 or newer):  git for-each-ref --format='delete %(refname)' refs/original | git update-ref --stdin git reflog expire --expire=now --all git gc --prune=now Counting objects: 2437, done. Delta compression using up to 4 threads. Compressing objects: 100% (1378/1378), done. Writing objects: 100% (2437/2437), done. Total 2437 (delta 1461), reused 1802 (delta 1048)   Note: You can also achieve this by pushing your filtered history to a new or empty repository and then making a fresh clone from GitHub.     Avoiding accidental commits in the future There are a few simple tricks to avoid committing things you don't want committed:  Use a visual program like GitHub Desktop or gitk to commit changes. Visual programs generally make it easier to see exactly which files will be added, deleted, and modified with each commit. Avoid the catch-all commands git add . and git commit -a on the command line—use git add filename and git rm filename to individually stage files, instead. Use git add --interactive to individually review and stage changes within each file. Use git diff --cached to review the changes that you have staged for commit. This is the exact diff that git commit will produce as long as you don't use the -a flag.   Further reading  git filter-branch main page Pro Git: Git Tools - Rewriting History ",

For more information about improved organization permissions, see \"Repository permission levels for an organization.\"  Warnings:  If there are members of your legacy Admin team who are not members of other teams, deleting the team will remove those members from the organization. Before deleting the team, ensure members are already direct members of the organization, or have collaborator access to necessary repositories. To prevent the loss of private forks made by members of the legacy Admin team, you must follow steps 1-3 below before deleting the legacy Admin team. Because \"admin\" is a term for organization members with specific access to certain repositories in the organization, we recommend you avoid that term in any team name you decide on.     Create a new team under the improved organization permissions model.  Add each of the members of your legacy admin team to the new team.  Give the new team equivalent access to each of the repositories the legacy team could access.  Delete the legacy admin team.

Web links to your existing repositories will continue to work. This can take a few minutes to complete after you initiate the change. Command line pushes from your local repository clones to the old remote tracking URLs will continue to work.  However, after changing your username, your old username will become available for anyone else to claim. If the new owner of your old username creates a repository with the same name as your repository, that will override the redirect entry and your redirect will stop working. Because of this possibility, we recommend you update all existing remote repository URLs after changing your username. GitHub cannot set up redirects for:   @mentions using your old username Links to Gists with your old username   Links to your previous profile page After changing your username, links to your previous profile page, such as https://github.com/previoususername, will return a 404 error. We recommend updating any links to your GitHub account from elsewhere, such as your LinkedIn or Twitter profile.  Your Git commits If your previous Git commits were correctly attributed to your account and displayed in your contributions graph, and they were made with an email address that is not your username@users.noreply.github.com address, they will continue to be correctly attributed to your new username. However, if your previous commits were made with your username@users.noreply.github.com address (because you chose to keep your email address private or set it as your Git email address) those commits will no longer be associated with your account or displayed on your contributions graph after changing your username.
